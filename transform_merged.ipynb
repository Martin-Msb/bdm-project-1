We address the timing yield problem for sequential circuits and propose a statistical approach to handle it. We consider the spatial and path reconvergence correlations between path delays, set-up time and hold time constraints, and clock skew due to process variations. We propose a method to get the timing yield based on the delay distributions of register-to-register paths in the circuit On average, the timing yield results obtained by our approach have average errors of less than 1.0% in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results show that shortest path variations and clock skew due to process variations have considerable impact on circuit timing, which could bias the timing yield results. In addition, the correlation between longest and shortest path delays is not significant.",[["53f43b03dabfaedce555bf2a",null,null,null,"Min Pan",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f45ee9dabfaee43ecda842",null,null,null,"Chris C.

On one hand, the more resources that are provisioned to a multitier web application, the easier it is to meet service level objectives (SLO). On the other hand, the virtual machine which hosts the multi-tier web application needs to be consolidated as much as possible in order to maintain high resource utilization. This paper presents an adaptive resource controller which consists of a feedback utilization controller and an auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA)-based model estimator. It can meet application-level quality of service (QoS) goals while achieving high resource utilization. To evaluate the proposed controllers, simulations are performed on a testbed simulating a virtual data center using Xen virtual machines. Experimental results indicate that the controllers can improve CPU utilization and make the best tradeoff between resource utilization and performance for multi-tier web applications.",[["53f46a22dabfaee0d9c3d5e5",null,"ysg_2005@hotmail.com","5b8698cce1cd8e14a3826671","Shuguo Yang",null,null,null,null,"School of Mathematics and Physics, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China 266061",null,"5f71b2e91c455f439fe3f23f",null,null,null]],"10.1007/s11704-011-0127-6",["Virtualization","Service level objective","Virtual machine","Computer science","Testbed","Quality of service","Provisioning","Resource allocation","Web application","Operating system","Distributed computing"],null,4,["resource allocation","cpu utilization","quality of service"],"en",2,512,506,null,["53e9a073b7602d9702957efa","53e9ad87b7602d970377bfb5","53e9be51b7602d9704b11381","53e9be04b7602d9704abb31d","53e9992bb7602d9702169236","53e998cdb7602d97021044db","53e9afa6b7602d97039f6054","53e99822b7602d9702044e60"],"Research on resource allocation for multi-tier web applications in a virtualization environment",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-011-0127-6","http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11704-011-0127-6","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],5,2011,"572de199d39c4f49934b3d5c"],["53e99792b7602d9701f5af1a","",[["5631df8845cedb3399f3e752",null,null,null,"Shigeru Fujita",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f4775edabfaee4dc891b69",null,null,null,"Kenji Sugawara",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["54096ca7dabfae450f483585",null,null,null,"Claude Moulin",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["5448b55bdabfae87b7e68206",null,null,null,"Jean-Paul A.

A feature is located by observing system execution and noting time intervals in which it is active. Traces of execution in intervals with and without the feature are compared. Earlier experience has shown that this analysis is difficult because distributed systems often exhibit stochastic behavior and because time intervals are hard to identify with precision. To get around these difficulties, the paper proposes a definition of time interval based on the causality analysis introduced by Lamport and others. A strict causal interval may be defined, but it must often be extended to capture latent events and to represent the inherent imprecision in time measurement. This extension is modeled using a weighting function which may be customized to the specific circumstances of each study. The end result of the analysis is a component relevance index, denoted p\"c, which can be used to measure the relevance of a software component to a particular feature. Software engineers may focus their analysis efforts on the top components as ranked according to p\"c. Two case studies are presented. The first study demonstrates the feasibility of p\"c by applying our method to a well-defined distributed system. The second study demonstrates the versatility of p\"c by applying our method to message logs obtained from a large military system. Both studies indicate that the suggested approach could be an effective guide for a software engineer who is maintaining or enhancing a distributed system.",[["53f43a51dabfaec22baa659b",null,"dedwards@cs.uwf.edu","5b8695e5e1cd8e14a36f684d","Dennis Edwards",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA",null,"5f71b2bd1c455f439fe3dea6",["Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA"],null,null],["53f3b3ffdabfae4b34b2dae9",null,"ssimmons@cs.uwf.edu","5b8695e5e1cd8e14a36f684d","Sharon Simmons",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA",null,"5f71b2bd1c455f439fe3dea6",["Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA"],null,null],["53f4333fdabfaeb22f451979",null,"nwilde@uwf.edu",null,"Norman Wilde",null,null,null,null,"Corresponding author.

Our technique operates by adding anti-forensic dither to a previously compressed image's wavelet coefficients so that the anti-forensically modified wavelet coefficient distribution matches a model of the coefficient distribution before compression.

Compared with the existing methods of fire station location our approach has three distinguish features: (1) considering fuzzy nature of a decision maker (DM) in the location optimization model; (2) fully considering the demands for the facilities from the areas with various fire risk categories; (3) being more understandable and practical to DM.

To ensure meaningful inference and prediction based on this model, it is important to verify that the operator @J does not change with time. We propose a method for testing the constancy of @J against a change-point alternative which uses the functional principal component analysis. The test statistic is constructed to have a well-known asymptotic distribution, but the asymptotic justification of the procedure is very delicate. We develop a new truncation approach which together with Mensov's inequality can be used in other problems of functional time series analysis. The estimation of the principal components introduces asymptotically non-negligible terms, which however cancel because of the special form of our test statistic (CUSUM type).

The contingencies arise when cutting some of those chains results in overload of the others. Simple reduction of power grid corresponding to aggregation of chain components significantly reduces the total number of distinct contingencies.

On one hand, the more resources that are provisioned to a multitier web application, the easier it is to meet service level objectives (SLO). On the other hand, the virtual machine which hosts the multi-tier web application needs to be consolidated as much as possible in order to maintain high resource utilization. This paper presents an adaptive resource controller which consists of a feedback utilization controller and an auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA)-based model estimator. It can meet application-level quality of service (QoS) goals while achieving high resource utilization. To evaluate the proposed controllers, simulations are performed on a testbed simulating a virtual data center using Xen virtual machines.

A feature is located by observing system execution and noting time intervals in which it is active. Traces of execution in intervals with and without the feature are compared. Earlier experience has shown that this analysis is difficult because distributed systems often exhibit stochastic behavior and because time intervals are hard to identify with precision. To get around these difficulties, the paper proposes a definition of time interval based on the causality analysis introduced by Lamport and others. A strict causal interval may be defined, but it must often be extended to capture latent events and to represent the inherent imprecision in time measurement. This extension is modeled using a weighting function which may be customized to the specific circumstances of each study. The end result of the analysis is a component relevance index, denoted p\"c, which can be used to measure the relevance of a software component to a particular feature. Software engineers may focus their analysis efforts on the top components as ranked according to p\"c. Two case studies are presented. The first study demonstrates the feasibility of p\"c by applying our method to a well-defined distributed system. The second study demonstrates the versatility of p\"c by applying our method to message logs obtained from a large military system. Both studies indicate that the suggested approach could be an effective guide for a software engineer who is maintaining or enhancing a distributed system.</td><td>List(List(53f43a51dabfaec22baa659b, null, dedwards@cs.uwf.edu, 5b8695e5e1cd8e14a36f684d, Dennis Edwards, null, null, null, null, Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA, null, 5f71b2bd1c455f439fe3dea6, List(Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA), null, null), List(53f3b3ffdabfae4b34b2dae9, null, ssimmons@cs.uwf.edu, 5b8695e5e1cd8e14a36f684d, Sharon Simmons, null, null, null, null, Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA, null, 5f71b2bd1c455f439fe3dea6, List(Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA), null, null), List(53f4333fdabfaeb22f451979, null, nwilde@uwf.edu, null, Norman Wilde, null, null, null, null, Corresponding author.

Compared with the existing methods of fire station location our approach has three distinguish features: (1) considering fuzzy nature of a decision maker (DM) in the location optimization model; (2) fully considering the demands for the facilities from the areas with various fire risk categories; (3) being more understandable and practical to DM.

It is defined by the equation X\"n\"+\"1=@JX\"n+@e\"n\"+\"1, in which the observations X\"n and errors @e\"n are curves, and @J is an operator. To ensure meaningful inference and prediction based on this model, it is important to verify that the operator @J does not change with time. We propose a method for testing the constancy of @J against a change-point alternative which uses the functional principal component analysis. The test statistic is constructed to have a well-known asymptotic distribution, but the asymptotic justification of the procedure is very delicate. We develop a new truncation approach which together with Mensov's inequality can be used in other problems of functional time series analysis. The estimation of the principal components introduces asymptotically non-negligible terms, which however cancel because of the special form of our test statistic (CUSUM type). The test is implemented using the R package fda, and its finite sample performance is examined by application to credit card transaction data.</td><td>List(List(54301e81dabfaeca69bca10d, null, null, 5b86919fe1cd8e14a353a903, Lajos Horváth, null, null, null, 0000-0001-8594-4972, Department of Mathematics, University of Utah, 155 South 1440 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-0090, USA, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6c8, List(Department of Mathematics, University of Utah, 155 South 1440 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-0090, USA), null, null), List(53f4647ddabfaee02ad8cbb6, null, null, 5b86ae49e1cd8e14a31057a0, Marie Hušková, null, null, null, 0000-0002-6868-1362, Department of Statistics, Charles University, Sokolovská 83, CZ-18600 Praha, Czech Republic, null, 5f71b2851c455f439fe3c70f, List(Department of Statistics, Charles University, Sokolovská 83, CZ-18600 Praha, Czech Republic), null, null), List(5448d49ddabfae87b7e82000, null, Piotr.Kokoszka@usu.edu, 5b8689c1e1cd8e14a3214e89, Piotr Kokoszka, null, null, null, null, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Utah State University, 3900 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322-3900, USA, null, 5f71b2961c455f439fe3ce40, List(Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Utah State University, 3900 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322-3900, USA, Corresponding author.), null, null))</td><td>10.1016/j.jmva.2008.12.008</td><td>List(Functional principal component analysis, Time series, Truncation, Autoregressive model, Applied mathematics, Test statistic, Credit card, Calculus, Statistical hypothesis testing, Mathematics, Asymptotic distribution)</td><td>null</td><td>2</td><td>List(asymptotic justification, observations x, equation x, functional principal component analysis, test statistic, credit card transaction data, principal component, functional autoregressive process, functional time series data, change-point, functional time series analysis, 62m10, time series data, autoregressive process, transaction data, asymptotic distribution, time series analysis)</td><td>en</td><td>62</td><td>367</td><td>352</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9ace1b7602d97036bc507, 53e999ffb7602d970224c172)</td><td>Testing the stability of the functional autoregressive process</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2008.12.008, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jmva.2008.12.008, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X08002789, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>101</td><td>2010</td><td>555036db7cea80f9541603d7</td></tr><tr><td>53e99792b7602d9701f5b223</td><td>We present the systematic analysis of all dangerous N-2 contingencies observed in medium size model of Polish power grid with about 2600 power lines. Each of the dangerous contingencies is composed of two initially tripped lines and one or more lines that overloaded as the result. There are 443 distinct contingencies that do not lead to immediate islanding of the grid. In the scope of the work we analyze the statistics of individual line participation in those contingencies and show that some lines have anomalously high rate of participation in the contingencies. Next, we show that about third of all the contingencies can be associated with the sub grids that are connected to the rest of the grid via small set of power line chains. The contingencies arise when cutting some of those chains results in overload of the others. Simple reduction of power grid corresponding to aggregation of chain components significantly reduces the total number of distinct contingencies. The rest of the contingencies are closely related to a set of almost dangerous N-1 contingencies that result in heavy loading of particular lines. Tripping many different additional lines on top of these N-1 contingencies results in an overload of one or more lines. We conclude our work by characterization of the joint distributions of power flows through the initiating and overloaded lines and statistical analysis of topological distance between the initially tripped and overloaded lines.</td><td>List(List(53f43756dabfaee0d9b6d4ce, null, null, null, P.

On one hand, the more resources that are provisioned to a multitier web application, the easier it is to meet service level objectives (SLO). On the other hand, the virtual machine which hosts the multi-tier web application needs to be consolidated as much as possible in order to maintain high resource utilization. This paper presents an adaptive resource controller which consists of a feedback utilization controller and an auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA)-based model estimator.

A feature is located by observing system execution and noting time intervals in which it is active. Traces of execution in intervals with and without the feature are compared. Earlier experience has shown that this analysis is difficult because distributed systems often exhibit stochastic behavior and because time intervals are hard to identify with precision. To get around these difficulties, the paper proposes a definition of time interval based on the causality analysis introduced by Lamport and others. A strict causal interval may be defined, but it must often be extended to capture latent events and to represent the inherent imprecision in time measurement. This extension is modeled using a weighting function which may be customized to the specific circumstances of each study. The end result of the analysis is a component relevance index, denoted p\"c, which can be used to measure the relevance of a software component to a particular feature. Software engineers may focus their analysis efforts on the top components as ranked according to p\"c. Two case studies are presented. The first study demonstrates the feasibility of p\"c by applying our method to a well-defined distributed system. The second study demonstrates the versatility of p\"c by applying our method to message logs obtained from a large military system. Both studies indicate that the suggested approach could be an effective guide for a software engineer who is maintaining or enhancing a distributed system.",[["53f43a51dabfaec22baa659b",null,"dedwards@cs.uwf.edu","5b8695e5e1cd8e14a36f684d","Dennis Edwards",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA",null,"5f71b2bd1c455f439fe3dea6",["Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA"],null,null],["53f3b3ffdabfae4b34b2dae9",null,"ssimmons@cs.uwf.edu","5b8695e5e1cd8e14a36f684d","Sharon Simmons",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA",null,"5f71b2bd1c455f439fe3dea6",["Department of Computer Science, University of West Florida, 11000 University Parkway, Pensacola, FL 32514, USA"],null,null],["53f4333fdabfaeb22f451979",null,"nwilde@uwf.edu",null,"Norman Wilde",null,null,null,null,"Corresponding author.

Within our approach, new cases are constructed using an iterative context-guided retrieval of case nodes from multiple cases.

In this paper, we propose an anti-forensic technique capable of removing artifacts indicative of wavelet-based image compression from an image. Our technique operates by adding anti-forensic dither to a previously compressed image's wavelet coefficients so that the anti-forensically modified wavelet coefficient distribution matches a model of the coefficient distribution before compression.

Compared with the existing methods of fire station location our approach has three distinguish features: (1) considering fuzzy nature of a decision maker (DM) in the location optimization model; (2) fully considering the demands for the facilities from the areas with various fire risk categories; (3) being more understandable and practical to DM.

To ensure meaningful inference and prediction based on this model, it is important to verify that the operator @J does not change with time. We propose a method for testing the constancy of @J against a change-point alternative which uses the functional principal component analysis. The test statistic is constructed to have a well-known asymptotic distribution, but the asymptotic justification of the procedure is very delicate. We develop a new truncation approach which together with Mensov's inequality can be used in other problems of functional time series analysis. The estimation of the principal components introduces asymptotically non-negligible terms, which however cancel because of the special form of our test statistic (CUSUM type).

The contingencies arise when cutting some of those chains results in overload of the others. Simple reduction of power grid corresponding to aggregation of chain components significantly reduces the total number of distinct contingencies. The rest of the contingencies are closely related to a set of almost dangerous N-1 contingencies that result in heavy loading of particular lines.

On one hand, the more resources that are provisioned to a multitier web application, the easier it is to meet service level objectives (SLO). On the other hand, the virtual machine which hosts the multi-tier web application needs to be consolidated as much as possible in order to maintain high resource utilization. This paper presents an adaptive resource controller which consists of a feedback utilization controller and an auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA)-based model estimator. It can meet application-level quality of service (QoS) goals while achieving high resource utilization. To evaluate the proposed controllers, simulations are performed on a testbed simulating a virtual data center using Xen virtual machines. Experimental results indicate that the controllers can improve CPU utilization and make the best tradeoff between resource utilization and performance for multi-tier web applications.</td><td>List(List(53f46a22dabfaee0d9c3d5e5, null, ysg_2005@hotmail.com, 5b8698cce1cd8e14a3826671, Shuguo Yang, null, null, null, null, School of Mathematics and Physics, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China 266061, null, 5f71b2e91c455f439fe3f23f, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/s11704-011-0127-6</td><td>List(Virtualization, Service level objective, Virtual machine, Computer science, Testbed, Quality of service, Provisioning, Resource allocation, Web application, Operating system, Distributed computing)</td><td>null</td><td>4</td><td>List(resource allocation, cpu utilization, quality of service)</td><td>en</td><td>2</td><td>512</td><td>506</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a073b7602d9702957efa, 53e9ad87b7602d970377bfb5, 53e9be51b7602d9704b11381, 53e9be04b7602d9704abb31d, 53e9992bb7602d9702169236, 53e998cdb7602d97021044db, 53e9afa6b7602d97039f6054, 53e99822b7602d9702044e60)</td><td>Research on resource allocation for multi-tier web applications in a virtualization environment</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-011-0127-6, http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11704-011-0127-6, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>5</td><td>2011</td><td>572de199d39c4f49934b3d5c</td><td>List(53f46a22dabfaee0d9c3d5e5)</td></tr><tr><td>53e99792b7602d9701f5af1a</td><td></td><td>List(List(5631df8845cedb3399f3e752, null, null, null, Shigeru Fujita, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f4775edabfaee4dc891b69, null, null, null, Kenji Sugawara, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(54096ca7dabfae450f483585, null, null, null, Claude Moulin, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(5448b55bdabfae87b7e68206, null, null, null, Jean-Paul A.

A feature is located by observing system execution and noting time intervals in which it is active. Traces of execution in intervals with and without the feature are compared. Earlier experience has shown that this analysis is difficult because distributed systems often exhibit stochastic behavior and because time intervals are hard to identify with precision. To get around these difficulties, the paper proposes a definition of time interval based on the causality analysis introduced by Lamport and others. A strict causal interval may be defined, but it must often be extended to capture latent events and to represent the inherent imprecision in time measurement. This extension is modeled using a weighting function which may be customized to the specific circumstances of each study. The end result of the analysis is a component relevance index, denoted p\"c, which can be used to measure the relevance of a software component to a particular feature. Software engineers may focus their analysis efforts on the top components as ranked according to p\"c. Two case studies are presented. The first study demonstrates the feasibility of p\"c by applying our method to a well-defined distributed system. The second study demonstrates the versatility of p\"c by applying our method to message logs obtained from a large military system.

Within our approach, new cases are constructed using an iterative context-guided retrieval of case nodes from multiple cases.

In this paper, we propose an anti-forensic technique capable of removing artifacts indicative of wavelet-based image compression from an image. Our technique operates by adding anti-forensic dither to a previously compressed image's wavelet coefficients so that the anti-forensically modified wavelet coefficient distribution matches a model of the coefficient distribution before compression.

This paper aims to determine the optimal location of fire station facilities. The proposed method is the combination of a fuzzy multi-objective programming and a genetic algorithm. The original fuzzy multiple objectives are appropriately converted to a single unified ‘min–max’ goal, which makes it easy to apply a genetic algorithm for the problem solving. Compared with the existing methods of fire station location our approach has three distinguish features: (1) considering fuzzy nature of a decision maker (DM) in the location optimization model; (2) fully considering the demands for the facilities from the areas with various fire risk categories; (3) being more understandable and practical to DM. The case study was based on the data collected from the Derbyshire fire and rescue service and used to illustrate the application of the method for the optimization of fire station locations.</td><td>List(List(5630ff9645cedb3399c3ca55, null, L.yang@lboro.ac.uk, null, Lili Yang, null, null, null, null, Business School, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire LE11 3TU, UK, null, 5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0d7, List(Business School, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire LE11 3TU, UK, Corresponding author.

It is defined by the equation X\"n\"+\"1=@JX\"n+@e\"n\"+\"1, in which the observations X\"n and errors @e\"n are curves, and @J is an operator. To ensure meaningful inference and prediction based on this model, it is important to verify that the operator @J does not change with time. We propose a method for testing the constancy of @J against a change-point alternative which uses the functional principal component analysis. The test statistic is constructed to have a well-known asymptotic distribution, but the asymptotic justification of the procedure is very delicate. We develop a new truncation approach which together with Mensov's inequality can be used in other problems of functional time series analysis. The estimation of the principal components introduces asymptotically non-negligible terms, which however cancel because of the special form of our test statistic (CUSUM type). The test is implemented using the R package fda, and its finite sample performance is examined by application to credit card transaction data.</td><td>List(List(54301e81dabfaeca69bca10d, null, null, 5b86919fe1cd8e14a353a903, Lajos Horváth, null, null, null, 0000-0001-8594-4972, Department of Mathematics, University of Utah, 155 South 1440 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-0090, USA, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6c8, List(Department of Mathematics, University of Utah, 155 South 1440 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-0090, USA), null, null), List(53f4647ddabfaee02ad8cbb6, null, null, 5b86ae49e1cd8e14a31057a0, Marie Hušková, null, null, null, 0000-0002-6868-1362, Department of Statistics, Charles University, Sokolovská 83, CZ-18600 Praha, Czech Republic, null, 5f71b2851c455f439fe3c70f, List(Department of Statistics, Charles University, Sokolovská 83, CZ-18600 Praha, Czech Republic), null, null), List(5448d49ddabfae87b7e82000, null, Piotr.Kokoszka@usu.edu, 5b8689c1e1cd8e14a3214e89, Piotr Kokoszka, null, null, null, null, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Utah State University, 3900 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322-3900, USA, null, 5f71b2961c455f439fe3ce40, List(Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Utah State University, 3900 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322-3900, USA, Corresponding author.), null, null))</td><td>10.1016/j.jmva.2008.12.008</td><td>List(Functional principal component analysis, Time series, Truncation, Autoregressive model, Applied mathematics, Test statistic, Credit card, Calculus, Statistical hypothesis testing, Mathematics, Asymptotic distribution)</td><td>null</td><td>2</td><td>List(asymptotic justification, observations x, equation x, functional principal component analysis, test statistic, credit card transaction data, principal component, functional autoregressive process, functional time series data, change-point, functional time series analysis, 62m10, time series data, autoregressive process, transaction data, asymptotic distribution, time series analysis)</td><td>en</td><td>62</td><td>367</td><td>352</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9ace1b7602d97036bc507, 53e999ffb7602d970224c172)</td><td>Testing the stability of the functional autoregressive process</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2008.12.008, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jmva.2008.12.008, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X08002789, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>101</td><td>2010</td><td>555036db7cea80f9541603d7</td><td>List(54301e81dabfaeca69bca10d, 53f4647ddabfaee02ad8cbb6, 5448d49ddabfae87b7e82000)</td></tr><tr><td>53e99792b7602d9701f5b223</td><td>We present the systematic analysis of all dangerous N-2 contingencies observed in medium size model of Polish power grid with about 2600 power lines. Each of the dangerous contingencies is composed of two initially tripped lines and one or more lines that overloaded as the result. There are 443 distinct contingencies that do not lead to immediate islanding of the grid. In the scope of the work we analyze the statistics of individual line participation in those contingencies and show that some lines have anomalously high rate of participation in the contingencies. Next, we show that about third of all the contingencies can be associated with the sub grids that are connected to the rest of the grid via small set of power line chains. The contingencies arise when cutting some of those chains results in overload of the others. Simple reduction of power grid corresponding to aggregation of chain components significantly reduces the total number of distinct contingencies. The rest of the contingencies are closely related to a set of almost dangerous N-1 contingencies that result in heavy loading of particular lines. Tripping many different additional lines on top of these N-1 contingencies results in an overload of one or more lines.

In this work we introduce a role-based approach for ad hoc teamwork, in which each teammate is inferred to be following a specialized role that accomplishes a specific task or exhibits a particular behavior. In such cases, the role an ad hoc agent should select depends both on its own capabilities and on the roles currently selected by other team members. We present methods for evaluating the influence of the ad hoc agent's role selection on the team's utility and we examine empirically how to choose the best suited method for role assignment in a complex environment.

The research objective is to find the tendencies of reader generated annotations during two social reading projects. For theoretical background, \"the significance of the text - social interaction model\" was used for the analysis conducted in this study, and we classified user generated annotations into three different types. As a result, participants had a tendency to make more annotations about their understanding and appreciation than regarding text interpretation. In addition, the result shows that the social e-book can promote fine-grained interactions. Regarding the comparison of the genres of the contents, the group of people who read the classic and humanities genre is more active than those who read the popular literature genre.

But many issues of concern to programmers don't cleanly follow these modularity boundaries—they don't \"fit\" naturally into these abstractions. We propose a new programming paradigm, called Aspect-Oriented Programming, that allows programmers to express each of the different issues they want to program in an appropriately natural form. A special kind of compiler called an Aspect Weaver™ then automatically combins those separate descriptions into a final executable form. By enabling engineers to reason and program using the natural aspects of concern for a system, even when those cross-cut both each other and the resulting executable code, we believe that Aspect-Oriented Programming will make it possible to program future extremely complex systems, as well as making it easier to program a number of more near term (even present and past) systems.",[["53f36889dabfae4b349a2ea8",null,null,"5b86b737e1cd8e14a34fea08","gregor kiczales",null,null,null,null,"university of british columbia",null,"5f71b28e1c455f439fe3cad2",null,null,null],["53f4302bdabfaee4dc73c49f",null,null,"5b86b6e9e1cd8e14a34dcda7","erik hilsdale",null,null,null,null,"parc",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6e9",null,null,null]],"10.1145/503271.503260",["Functional reactive programming","Procedural programming","Programming language","Software design","Computer science","AspectJ","Concurrent object-oriented programming","Programming domain","Functional logic programming","Programming paradigm","Aspect-oriented programming","Software engineering","Inductive programming","Separation of concerns","Reactive programming","Modular design","Java","Modularity"],null,5,["aspect-oriented programming","agent-oriented programming","software design","separation of concern","modularity","programming language","aspect oriented programming","aspect oriented"],"en",9952,null,313,"//static.aminer.org/pdf/20170130/pdfs/sigsoft/9ql40mmuc1ietqp2pa7rsa3vdgbhezfo.pdf",["53e99a4eb7602d97022b29be"],"Aspect-oriented programming",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/503271.503260","https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/503271.503260"],26,2001,"0163-5948",["53f36889dabfae4b349a2ea8","53f4302bdabfaee4dc73c49f"],"5f71b28e1c455f439fe3cad2"],["53e997f1b7602d9701ff2ea5","Techniques for automatically generating optimal vision programs from high-level task descriptions are presented.

At this early stage of development, only overall goals of features are understood, and there is a need to discover all possible scenarios of operation. We have developed a formalism - Structured Transition Systems (STS) - that facilitates the rapid evolution of specifications. STS supports multiple idioms of specification : transitions, state-diagrams, scenarios etc. It also supports constructs for hierarchical organization of a specification. We have further defined analyses that are useful for review and inspection of STS specifications. A distinctive feature of our method is the ability to use analysis results to refine and reinforce parts of the specification by importing analysis results into STS specifications. In practice, this leads to a feedback loop where requirements can be rapidly refined using analysis engines to drive the development of requirements. We have experimented using our technique on a number of automotive case-studies, and we present some of our experiences with these case-studies.",[["54302a26dabfaeca69bd07ca",null,null,"5b8698e8e1cd8e14a38325e2","Sampath, P.",null,null,null,null,"India Sci.

It has been argued in the literature that ''a marriage of classical cutting planes and tree search is out of the question as far as the solution of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems is concerned'' [16] because the cuts generated at one node of the search tree need not be valid at other nodes. We show that it is possible, by using a simple lifting procedure, to make Gomory cuts generated at a node of the enumeration tree globally valid in the case of mixed 0-1 programs. The procedure essentially amounts to treating the variables fixed at 0 or 1 as if they were free. We also show why this lifting procedure is not valid for general (other than 0-1) mixed integer programs. Other issues addressed in the paper are of a computational nature, such as strategies for generating the cutting planes, deciding between branching and cutting, etc. The result is a robust mixed integer program solver.",[["53f48444dabfaec09f2a69bb",null,null,"5b86ad3de1cd8e14a3096f9d","E.

SVD is powerful at finding the global solution to the associated least-square-error minimization problem. However, this is the correct error to minimize only when the x and y positional errors in the features are uncorrelated and identically distributed. But this is rarely the case in real data. Uncertainty in feature position depends on the underlying spatial intensity structure in the image, which has strong directionality to it. Hence, the proper measure to minimize is covariance-weighted squared-error (or the Mahalanobis distance). In this paper, we describe a new approach to covariance-weighted factorization, which can factor noisy feature correspondences with high degree of directional uncertainty into structure and motion. Our approach is based on transforming the raw-data into a covariance-weighted data space, where the components of noise in the different directions are uncorrelated and identically distributed. Applying SVD to the transformed data now minimizes a meaningful objective function in this new data space. This is followed by a linear but suboptimal second step to recover the shape and motion in the original data space. We empirically show that our algorithm gives very good results for varying degrees of directional uncertainty. In particular, we show that unlike other SVD-based factorization algorithms, our method does not degrade with increase in directionality of uncertainty, even in the extreme when only normal-flow data is available. It thus provides a unified approach for treating corner-like points together with points along linear structures in the image.",[["54406eaadabfae805a6bd3ad",null,null,"5b8694a4e1cd8e14a367346f","P.

Apart from testing, proving is a viable technique for establishing correctness of algorithms. There exists a clear link to systems theory. Some restrictions have to be imposed on systems theory to obtain executability, but these restrictions are fewer than assumed normally when systems are described in imperative programming languages.

ad hoc team setting is one in which teammates must work together to obtain a common goal, but without any prior agreement regarding how to work together. In this work we introduce a role-based approach for ad hoc teamwork, in which each teammate is inferred to be following a specialized role that accomplishes a specific task or exhibits a particular behavior. In such cases, the role an ad hoc agent should select depends both on its own capabilities and on the roles currently selected by other team members. We present methods for evaluating the influence of the ad hoc agent's role selection on the team's utility and we examine empirically how to choose the best suited method for role assignment in a complex environment. Finally, we show that an appropriate assignment method can be determined from a limited amount of data and used successfully in new tasks that the team has not encountered before.</td><td>List(List(53f43819dabfaee02acd9ff6, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598, Katie Genter, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at Austin, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf, null, null, null), List(53f434b5dabfaeecd694fcdf, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598, Noa Agmon, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at Austin, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf, null, null, null), List(53f42d28dabfaeb2acfe712a, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598, Peter Stone, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at Austin, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf, null, null, null))</td><td>null</td><td>List(Teamwork, Computer science, Knowledge management, Human–computer interaction)</td><td>0-9817381-3-3</td><td>null</td><td>List(role assignment, appropriate assignment method, specialized role, common goal, role selection, complex environment, present method, team member, team setting, limited amount)</td><td>en</td><td>1</td><td>1252</td><td>1251</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997d7b7602d9701fd0004_0.pdf</td><td>List(53e9a309b7602d9702c14b8b, 53e99858b7602d970208f24f, 53e9aa61b7602d97033d4b67, 53e9a1e1b7602d9702ae0e7e, 53e9a6cab7602d9702fff64d)</td><td>Role selection in ad hoc teamwork</td><td>List(http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2343948)</td><td>null</td><td>2012</td><td>555037187cea80f954172d7a</td><td>List(53f43819dabfaee02acd9ff6, 53f434b5dabfaeecd694fcdf, 53f42d28dabfaeb2acfe712a)</td><td>5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf</td></tr><tr><td>53e997ddb7602d9701fd2cce</td><td>A social e-book provides not only the original text but also other readers&' comments, and it enables social interactions inside the book. We posited that a social e-book could be a useful tool for collaborative learning, and it could provide new opportunities for classic humanities texts. The research objective is to find the tendencies of reader generated annotations during two social reading projects. For theoretical background, \"the significance of the text - social interaction model\" was used for the analysis conducted in this study, and we classified user generated annotations into three different types. As a result, participants had a tendency to make more annotations about their understanding and appreciation than regarding text interpretation. In addition, the result shows that the social e-book can promote fine-grained interactions. Regarding the comparison of the genres of the contents, the group of people who read the classic and humanities genre is more active than those who read the popular literature genre. For future study, more specific ways to improve interest and understanding will be examined for effective collaborative reading experiences through the social e-book.</td><td>List(List(53f466afdabfaeee22a54847, null, null, 5b868af8e1cd8e14a32924f3, Seyeon Lee, null, null, null, null, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, South Korea, null, 5f71b2831c455f439fe3c61e, null, null, null), List(53f467fadabfaedd74e6ffbd, null, null, 5b868af8e1cd8e14a32924f3, Jea In Kim, null, null, null, null, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, South Korea, null, 5f71b2831c455f439fe3c61e, null, null, null), List(53f43a87dabfaee02acf230a, null, null, 5b868af8e1cd8e14a32924f3, Chung-Kon Shi, null, null, null, null, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, South Korea, null, 5f71b2831c455f439fe3c61e, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/978-3-642-39371-6_6</td><td>List(Social group, Social relation, World Wide Web, Social media, Collaborative learning, Future study, Psychology, Social learning, Epistemology, Social competence)</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>List(social reading project, reader experience, original text, collaborative learning, text interpretation, social interaction model, social e-book, effective collaborative reading experience, social interaction, future study, classic humanities text)</td><td>en</td><td>0</td><td>57</td><td>50</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b86db7602d9704439294, 53e9b130b7602d9703bb0b59, 53e9b39db7602d9703e80f29)</td><td>Assessing the possibility of a social e-book by analyzing reader experiences</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39371-6_6)</td><td>null</td><td>2013</td><td>53a7261520f7420be8b66689</td><td>List(53f466afdabfaeee22a54847, 53f467fadabfaedd74e6ffbd, 53f43a87dabfaee02acf230a)</td><td>5f71b2831c455f439fe3c61e</td></tr><tr><td>53e997e4b7602d9701fdcbe4</td><td>This is the fourth year in which a team from University College Dublin has participated in the Multi-Agent Programming Contest.

We have developed a formalism - Structured Transition Systems (STS) - that facilitates the rapid evolution of specifications. STS supports multiple idioms of specification : transitions, state-diagrams, scenarios etc. It also supports constructs for hierarchical organization of a specification. We have further defined analyses that are useful for review and inspection of STS specifications. A distinctive feature of our method is the ability to use analysis results to refine and reinforce parts of the specification by importing analysis results into STS specifications. In practice, this leads to a feedback loop where requirements can be rapidly refined using analysis engines to drive the development of requirements. We have experimented using our technique on a number of automotive case-studies, and we present some of our experiences with these case-studies.</td><td>List(List(54302a26dabfaeca69bd07ca, null, null, 5b8698e8e1cd8e14a38325e2, Sampath, P., null, null, null, null, India Sci.

It has been argued in the literature that ''a marriage of classical cutting planes and tree search is out of the question as far as the solution of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems is concerned'' [16] because the cuts generated at one node of the search tree need not be valid at other nodes. We show that it is possible, by using a simple lifting procedure, to make Gomory cuts generated at a node of the enumeration tree globally valid in the case of mixed 0-1 programs. The procedure essentially amounts to treating the variables fixed at 0 or 1 as if they were free. We also show why this lifting procedure is not valid for general (other than 0-1) mixed integer programs. Other issues addressed in the paper are of a computational nature, such as strategies for generating the cutting planes, deciding between branching and cutting, etc. The result is a robust mixed integer program solver.</td><td>List(List(53f48444dabfaec09f2a69bb, null, null, 5b86ad3de1cd8e14a3096f9d, E.

SVD is powerful at finding the global solution to the associated least-square-error minimization problem. However, this is the correct error to minimize only when the x and y positional errors in the features are uncorrelated and identically distributed. But this is rarely the case in real data. Uncertainty in feature position depends on the underlying spatial intensity structure in the image, which has strong directionality to it. Hence, the proper measure to minimize is covariance-weighted squared-error (or the Mahalanobis distance). In this paper, we describe a new approach to covariance-weighted factorization, which can factor noisy feature correspondences with high degree of directional uncertainty into structure and motion. Our approach is based on transforming the raw-data into a covariance-weighted data space, where the components of noise in the different directions are uncorrelated and identically distributed. Applying SVD to the transformed data now minimizes a meaningful objective function in this new data space. This is followed by a linear but suboptimal second step to recover the shape and motion in the original data space. We empirically show that our algorithm gives very good results for varying degrees of directional uncertainty. In particular, we show that unlike other SVD-based factorization algorithms, our method does not degrade with increase in directionality of uncertainty, even in the extreme when only normal-flow data is available. It thus provides a unified approach for treating corner-like points together with points along linear structures in the image.</td><td>List(List(54406eaadabfae805a6bd3ad, null, null, 5b8694a4e1cd8e14a367346f, P.

The prime motivation is to show that functional programming languages are useful in software engineering practice. All kinds of systems, either with or without a state, can be modelled in a simple way. An attempt is made to devise executable models that are amenable to mathematical proofs. Apart from testing, proving is a viable technique for establishing correctness of algorithms. There exists a clear link to systems theory. Some restrictions have to be imposed on systems theory to obtain executability, but these restrictions are fewer than assumed normally when systems are described in imperative programming languages. As a consequence, an executable specification language is obtained. The well known `functional specs' can be written in a purely functional programming language.
