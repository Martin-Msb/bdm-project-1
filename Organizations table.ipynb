We propose a novel language for describing human behavior and social phenomena, set within a general theory of collective behavior and structure formation, with a resulting architecture that can be broadly applied. This work represents the blue print for a Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) design language in which agency is granted in a quantitative, rather than the traditional qualitative way. The relevant agents in the proposed system are intermediate in the sense that they are both influenced by an upper level with its own degree of agency, while at the same time they are determined by relatively independent subcomponents that must be ‚Äòsubdued‚Äô into acceptable behavior. Any observed action is considered to be the result of the interplay of multiple distinguishable actors. We put forward this language as a basis for the construction of large-scale simulations and for the description of complex social phenomena.

Daniel L. Hartl and Andrew G. Clark. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Massachusetts. 1997. Pp. 542. Price ¬£39.95, hardback. ISBN 0 87893 306 9. There is demand for a more widespread understanding of population genetics. Many a 'health scare of the week' highlights the lack of public understanding of population processes. Areas ranging from law enforcement through agricultural and medical practice to biological conservation now require some expertise in population genetics. Does this book promise to satisfy the demand? Star qualities are immediately apparent: enthusiasm for the subject, a clear overview, and a universal style. Such qualities did not arise overnight. The two previous editions were considered to be the leading modern text for advanced undergraduates and beginning postgraduates. However, I feel that the presentation is too ambitious for most undergraduates, especially for those with no background. For such, Professor Hartl's Primer in Population Genetics (2nd edn) from the same publisher will provide a more accessible introduction. To make life simpler, education tends towards telling a linear story. Population genetics on the other hand resembles a multidimensional jigsaw puzzle: its language is a colourful amalgam of physical mechanisms, mathematical models, and statistical descriptions. This text deals with the conflict by dividing the subject into its major processes and applications. Nonetheless, the authors try to emphasize connectedness: for example, between inbreeding and genetic drift. Another recurring theme is the current deficit in our understanding of the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation. The third edition introduces many changes in structure and content. The effect is to give a better flow from background concepts through processes to applications. The genetic system at the centre of attention is the classical gene in an outbreeding diploid. Nonetheless, glimpses are provided of other systems, such as selfing plants, transposable elements and bacterial chromosomes. The first two chapters provide the genetic and statistical background. The resolution of the conflict between the biometrical and Mendelian views of inheritance by Sir Ronald Fisher is inserted to give the subject a historical perspective. Chapters three to seven form the core of the book, and describe the main influences on genetic variation, including the relationship between gene and genotype, population subdivision, inbreeding, mutation, recombination and migration. Chapter six provides a panorama of Darwinian selection, from single gene models, through the mutation-selection balance and interactions with genetic drift, to all the complexities of age-structured populations and epistasis. The long-standing debate about the relative roles of selection and drift in adaptive evolution is referred to without the reader becoming enmeshed, and Kimura's neutral theory is accorded the role of universal null hypothesis in this context. The reader is given a taste of the diffusion theory which identified the equilibrium states of the classical literature, and which led to the latest coalescence models. Chapters eight and nine deal with two major applications of population genetic theory: molecular evolution and quantitative genetics. The use of insights from the neutral theory to interpret protein and DNA sequence data is described, as are the methods for gene tree construction. Important applications of gene trees are described: for hypothesis tests of the direction of organismal trait evolution, for estimation of long-term migration rates, and for demonstrating selection at the gene level over evolutionary time scales. Quantitative genetics is given the standard presentation: the definition of heritability, and the estimation of components of genetic variance. The use of dense linkage maps for locating quantitative trait loci is presented as one way to elucidate the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation. The book ends on this characteristically optimistic note. This book is essential reading for anyone requiring a firm foundation in modern population genetics. Arabidopsis Protocols (Methods in Molecular Biology 82). Jos√© M. Mart√≠nez-Zapater and Julio Salinas (eds). Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey. 1998. Pp. 440. Price $79.50, hardback. ISBN 0 89603391 0. Arabidopsis Protocols represents a timely publication that is aimed to fill a niche within a market full of plant molecular biology-related titles. Interest in Arabidopsis as an experimental model for higher plants has increased exponentially since the mid-1980s and is set to rise even further with the impending completion of its genome project soon after the millennium. The strongly nucleic acid-related theme within many chapters of the book reflects the array of techniques that are currently being employed by the international Arabidopsis community to map and clone their target genes. However, Arabidopsis Protocols does far more than provide solace for the loneliness of the long-distance chromosome walker. Initial chapters provide basic, yet important, information for new Arabidopsis researchers ‚Äî how to grow this weed successfully! This section includes useful chapters by Mary Anderson describing the control of Arabidopsis pests and diseases, plus Randy Scholl and colleagues detail how they preserve the longevity of Arabidopsis seed. In contrast, Part 2 proved disappointing. Whilst I commend the editors for including chapters describing the purification of Arabidopsis organelles and macromolecules, I was surprised to discover that Arabidopsis cells only contain mitochondrial and chloroplast organelles and that their macromolecules are totally nucleic acid-based! The inclusion of a chapter describing the subfractionation of Arabidopsis cellular membranes would have gone a long way towards balancing this section. Part 3 proved excellent reading, particularly the chapters on seed mutagenesis and genetic analysis which included useful introductory discussions, whilst Part 4 comprehensively describes PCR and RFLP-based techniques used to map Arabidopsis genes and mutations. Transient and stable Arabidopsis transformation techniques provide the theme for Part 5, including a description of vacuum-based in planta, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation by Bechtold and Pelletier. However, I was surprised to see no reference being made to detergent-based in planta transformation methodologies which are currently gaining favour amongst many Arabidopsis laboratories. Commendably, the treatment of gene cloning within Part 6 was well balanced, contrasting chromosome walking and landing strategies with transposon and T-DNA-based gene tagging approaches. The final section addresses techniques used to study Arabidopsis gene expression including a selection of chapters describing in situ hybridisation, reporter genes and, particularly enjoyable, in vivo footprinting. However, I was disappointed that the editors did not include a chapter on the localisation of those well known DNA by-products, proteins! This omission emphasises the overall nucleic acid-based theme within Arabidopsis Protocols. Whilst it is fair to say that the majority of Arabidopsis researchers are presently engrossed with nucleic acid-related topics, there is a growing interest in post-transcriptional processes. In summary, Arabidopsis Protocols provides an excellent technical reference for molecular geneticists, old and new, and will represent a 'must-have' text for every Arabidopsis laboratory for the next decade. Principles of Genome Analysis (2nd edn). S. B. Primrose. Blackwell Science, Oxford. 1998. Pp 193. Price ¬£19.50, paperback. ISBN 0 632 04983 9. S. B. Primrose has authored or co-authored several books like this one: heavily illustrated texts of between 100 and 200 pages on subjects related to gene manipulation. Each is aimed at a broad market ‚Äî students, lecturers or researchers interested in understanding, or considering entry to, the fields in question. All provide references to both the original literature and to appropriate reviews (about 400 references are cited in this volume). The two most successful, Introduction to Modern Virology (latterly with Dimmock) and Principles of Gene Manipulation (with Old) are in their 4th and 5th editions, respectively, and have increased in size several fold (to about 400 pages). Principles of Gene Manipulation is used as a teaching text in this University. Each of these books was last updated in 1994. Principles of Genome Analysis, subtitled A Guide to Mapping and Sequencing DNA from Different Organisms was first published in 1995 and has now been republished in revised, although not much lengthened, form. The subject of this volume is, of course, extremely timely. With public interest in human genome analysis reaching heights unprecedented for a problem in fundamental biological research, and with both large-scale commercial and government funding earmarked for the sequencing and analysis of the genomes of dozens of different species, the constituency of those interested in this volume should be both large and diverse. The book is divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1 attempts both to explain the benefits of genome sequencing, from the lofty ('detailed understanding of the organism will only be achieved when every gene has been identified and its transcript and the timing of transcript synthesis known') to the practical (a more efficient way to find disease genes). It also lists sequencing projects which are underway, describes some techniques, and outlines the rest of the book. I found Chapter 2 on the organization and structure of genomes (with the lowest density of 'practical' information) the most interesting. As one more familiar with prokaryotes, the complexity and variability (even amongst related species) of eukaryotic DNA organization creates for me a bewildering picture: why does the cow have a genome which harbours 25% tandemly repeated DNA? Why is mammalian DNA heavily punctuated with functionally inactive interspersed repeats? Why do introns vary in size and frequency between species? Chapter 3 is a straightforward exposition of methods for subdividing chromosomes into minichromosomes and other vectors as a preliminary to sequencing and gene mapping. Chapter 4 offers a real challenge to the novice; it presents a veritable alphabet soup (fortunately there is an abbreviations list at the start of the book) of ingenious methods for assembling physical maps. I think, for the non-expert, it is more to be dipped into than assimilated. Chapter 5, on sequencing, began as a welcome relief but progressed to an explication of sequencing on microchips which defeated me. Chapter 6, on sequence analysis and new to this edition, is only 12 pages long and surprisingly, considering the subject matter of the rest of the book, concentrates primarily on bacterial genome sequences with heavy reference to the publications of Koonin and collaborators. Others are more circumspect than he at declaring pairs of genes homologous and the impression is perhaps given here that genes (and their functions) are more conserved between species than may eventually prove to be the case. The final chapter deals with finding genes in the DNA-haystack of large genomes. The text is well illustrated with mostly useful diagrams (some borrowed from Principles of Gene Manipulation), although some were hard to understand, and with a lesser number of tables (I would have liked more). There are a number of proof-reading errors, omissions (several references are absent from the reference lists) difficult or inadequate figure captions and the occasional misstatement, but these do not seriously detract from the usefulness of the book. Although I suspect that private purchases may be limited, this is certainly a volume with a place in every comprehensive biology library. Genetic Structure and Local Adaptation in Natural Insect Populations. Susan Mopper and Sharon Y. Strauss (eds). Chapman and Hall, New York. 1997. Pp. 449. Price ¬£65.00, hardback. ISBN 041208031 1. Some 30 years ago, three seminal papers were published that have steered subsequent work on insect/plant interactions. First, Hairston, Smith & Slobodkin (now known as HSS, 1960) published a short note based on the observation that 'the world is green' and that the nature of population regulation depends on the trophic level examined. This work sparked research and controversy eventually leading to debates on the role of competition vs. other forces in structuring ecological communities. Following HSS, Ehrlich & Raven (1964) made the case for reciprocal coevolution between plants and insects, prompting investigations into the role of phytochemistry in insect/plant interactions, as well as phylogenetic tests of macro-evolutionary cospeciation between insects and plants. Finally, Bush (1969) stirred the pot with evidence from plant associated flies of sympatric speciation, a topic that remains controversial to this day. Now, 30 years later, we are wondering where this field stands. For the past decade, Denno & McClure's (1983) Variable Plants and Herbivores in Natural and Managed Systems and Strong, Lawton & Southwood's (1984) Insects on Plants provided the backbone for this discipline. In this volume, Mopper and Strauss have offered a much-needed update to these well-worn bibles of insect/plant interactions. It is an impressive collection of well-edited papers that focus on the genetic issues at the heart of insect/plant interactions, and in particular the importance of demic adaptation. In the past third of a century, the field has matured, not coincidentally as a result of more sophisticated genetic techniques as well as methods of analysis. So, what's new? Several themes emerge. As Boecklen & Mopper (Ch. 4) point out, the proper designs to test for local adaptation are now recognized, and the relevant data are pulled together here for the first time. Picture insects feeding on plants. First, selection for adaptation to host plants can be strong enough to overcome most scenarios of gene flow (Strauss & Karban, Ch. 8), and, as a result, local adaptation can occur at several possible scales, for example, individual plants, plant species, and sites (Mopper, Ch. 7). Local adaptation can lead to the formation of demes (Alstad, Ch. 1; Stiling & Rossi, Ch. 2), but not always (Cobb &Whitham, Ch. 3; Boecklen & Mopper, Ch. 4; Hanks & Denno, Ch. 11). Dispersal, or lack thereof, is critical in permitting local adaptation (Mopper, Ch. 7; Strauss & Karban, Ch. 8, Hanks & Denno, Ch. 11; Thomas & Singer, Ch. 14). Feeding style (Stiling & Rossi, Ch. 2), inherited environmental effects (Rossiter, Ch. 6), social behaviour and other intrademic structure (McCauley & Goff, Ch. 9; Costa, Ch. 10), life history patterns (Peterson & Denno, Ch. 12), and many sorts of habitat heterogeneity (Gandon et al., Ch. 13), all influence the magnitude of gene flow if not the likelihood of local adaptation. Finally, host fidelity can act as a reproductive barrier to gene flow either partially (Thomas & Singer, Ch. 14; Itami et al., Ch. 15) or nearly completely (Feder et al., Ch. 16). Given that the book is a solid and important contribution to the field, is anything missing? The mechanisms underlying adaptation have received little attention by the contributors and are 'conspicuous by their absence' (Berenbaum & Zangerl, Ch. 5). This criticism may be valid‚Äìreciprocal transplant studies used to detect local adaptation often make it difficult to distinguish among various selective mechanisms. However, this is a criticism of the field rather than the book. One promising area that was overlooked in the book is the use of phylogenetics or genealogies to understand the evolution of host associations, although Itami et al. (Ch. 15) come close. With regards to organization, I have four reservations about the volume. First, the collection of papers is dominated by North American schools of insect/plant studies ‚Äì 15 of 16 papers; the 16th, Gandon et al., is out of France. Second, the authors missed an opportunity to comment on the chapters ‚Äî the four sections would have benefited from both synthesis and perspective. Third, the index is thin at seven pages, compared to 37 pages in Denno & McClure (albeit a larger volume) and 20 pages in Strong, Lawton & Southwood (a smaller volume) which included a very useful author index, an unfortunate omission here. Fourth, and this one is for the publishers, ¬£65.00 is beyond the grasp of most graduate students worldwide. Does it really cost this much to produce an edited volume of 16 papers when academics write these chapters for free? That said, who will want to read the book? I would recommend the book as required reading for anyone interested in insect/plant interactions. Perhaps more importantly, it is an outstanding source of ideas. The perfect target would be students in a seminar setting, or a grant-starved professor submitting another proposal on insect/plant interactions (thank you!), or a beginning PhD student looking for a project. But, for those of you whose daily encounters with entomofauna is a splat on the windshield and the millennium bug, there is still a lot here ‚Äî genetic differentiation, selection, adaptation, speciali-zation, life-history variation, speciation, and biodiversity. There is no doubt this field is evolving quickly, so read the book and keep up with the Red Queen! Melanism: Evolution in Action. Michael E. N. Majerus. Oxford University Press, Oxford. 1998. Pp. 338. Price ¬£23.95, paperback. ISBN 0 19 854982 2. The classical example of natural selection at work concerns melanism (the occurrence of dark forms). Probably all biologists have heard about 'the peppered moth story', first published by Kettlewell in Heredity. The simple version of the story is that once upon a time there were two forms of the peppered moth (Biston betularia), a common white one and a rare black one. When pollution made tree trunks black, more whites than blacks were eaten by birds, and since then most peppered moths in industrial areas are black. If you suspect that the reality is not as simple as that you are right. The moths, for example, do not normally rest on tree trunks, and intermediate forms exist. Michael Majerus dissects the story in his book on melanism and shows that it is more complex and fascinating than most biologists will have realized. The book starts with general principles. First what melanism is and its possible causes, then principles of genetics and finally those of evolutionary processes. Readers of Heredity can skip the genetic part, unless they want to have a clearly written text that explains genetics at the very basic level. Likewise the evolutionary part: it is basic, but might be suitable in a course for first year students. The remainder of the book is on melanism in specific groups of organisms. First two chapters on the peppered moth, then two on other moths, and finally a large chapter on ladybirds. The reason for the choice of organisms is not that melanism is restricted to them, but simply that the author happens to work on them. Is the book therefore only of interest to those who work on moths and ladybirds? Surely not! By ignoring the book workers on other organisms would make the same mistake that Majerus did, missing interesting and important work outside their own realm. The author states in the preface that one of his original goals was to 'update Kettlewell' but that this was not achievable in one book. Instead he has 'used only those examples known to me to illustrate the points I have tried to make'. His real aim then was to engender renewed interest in melanism. But he could have done a better job in this respect. By sticking to his 'own organisms' he missed the opportunity to highlight several important topics related to melanism. There is, for example, nice work on plasticity in melanism, and on the relationship between the darkness of wings and mate locating behaviour in butterflies. The author apparently also missed the fact that the forms of the scarlet tiger moth (Panaxia dominula) are mainly determined by temperature, thereby making it useless as an illustration of balanced polymorphism. The book is almost exclusively on cases of melanism with discrete forms determined by a few alleles. Heritabilities are hardly mentioned, although there exists work dealing with continuous variation, even in 'his own' ladybirds. I found the last section on 'the future of research into melanism' disappointing. I think that the most exciting opportunities arise by integrating different biological disciplines. What, for example, is the developmental basis of the spots in ladybirds, is it the same in the different forms, and in different species? By combining such questions with a phylogenetic approach we would really learn something new about the evolution of melanism. The book is, however, very readable ‚Äî something which cannot be said of many books containing so much interesting scientific material.",[[null,null,null,"5b8696f3e1cd8e14a376503f","John Dallas",null,null,null,null,"1NERC Molecular Genetics in Ecology Initiative, Department of Zoology, University of Aberdeen, Tillydrone Avenue, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, UK",null,"5f71b2921c455f439fe3cc52",null,null,null],["53f4cfdbdabfaeedd877d78a",null,null,"5b86c96ee1cd8e14a3d31959","Malcolm J Bennett",null,null,null,null,"2Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK",null,"5f71b2871c455f439fe3c7fd",null,null,null],[null,null,null,"5b86c802e1cd8e14a3c8bae8","Millicent Masters",null,null,null,null,"3Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Edinburgh, Kings Buildings, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, UK",null,"5f71b4a31c455f439fe4b735",null,null,null],[null,null,null,"5b86bc34e1cd8e14a374114c","George k Roderick",null,null,null,null,"4Center for Conservation Research and Training, 3050 Maile Way, 409 Gilmore, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, USA",null,"5f71b2901c455f439fe3cba3",null,null,null],["53f44ccadabfaee1c0b0690e",null,null,"5b868a2fe1cd8e14a3241e3b","Jack J Windig",null,null,null,null,"5Department of Zoology, University of Stockholm, S 106 91 Stockholm, Sweden",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c682",null,null,null]],"10.1093/icb/42.2.408",null,"","1540-7063","2",["book review","genetics"," eukaryotes"," ecological"," population and evolutionary genetics","human population genetics"," genomics"," post-genomics","biometrical and statistical genetics"," animal and plant breeding","cytogenetics"],"en",2,"408","408","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e9979eb7602d9701f6eea1_0.pdf",null,"Book reviews.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/42.2.408","http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/IFS-1994-2108","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21708734?report=xml&format=text","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1046/j.1365-2540.1998.00470.x","http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v81/n4/full/6884700a.html","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00287783"],["555036d07cea80f954159906",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Math.

We show, in particular, that the `admissibility' semantics for all these formalisms has a natural argumentation-theoretic interpretation and proof procedure, which seem to correspond well with informal argumentation.In the admissibility semantics there is only one way for one argument to attack another, namely by undermining one of its non-provability claims.

If such a matrix is dened over a principal ideal domain, this is equivalent to con- sidering its Smith normal form or its cokernel. Many variations of the enumeration methods result in equivalent matrices. In particular, Gessel-Viennot matrices are equivalent to Kasteleyn-Percus matrices. We apply these ideas to plane partitions and related planar of tilings. We list a number of conjectures, supported by experiments in Maple, about the forms of matrices associated to enumerations of plane partitions and other lozenge tilings of planar regions and their symmetry classes. We focus on the case where the enumerations are round or q-round, and we conjecture that cokernels remain round or q-round for related \\impossible enumerations\" in which there are no tilings. Our conjectures provide a new view of the topic of enumerating symmetry classes of plane partitions and their generalizations. In particular we conjecture that a q- specialization of a Jacobi-Trudi matrix has a Smith normal form.

Unfortunately, some of that behavior and knowledge incur societal costs, particularly with regards to Privacy, which is viewed quite differently by different populations as well as regulated differently in different locales. But clever technical solutions to those challenges may impose additional societal costs, e.g., by consuming substantial resources at odds with Green Computing, another major area of societal concern. We propose a new crosscutting research area, Societal Computing, that focuses on the technical tradeoffs among computational models and application domains that raise significant societal issues.

The MSC.Software code Patran was used as the pre and post processor, and the MSC.Software code Dytran as the computational engine. The Catia model was not suitable for meshing, but the geometry therein was transferred to a new group and became the basis for the model. With further study of copies of the large engineering drawings, a faithful replica of the Comanche tailcone was constructed. The final geometry consists of 56 surfaces and 10 solids. The tailcone structure is meshed with 25,261 Lagrangian elements (16,665 2-D shell elements plus 8,596 3-D solid elements) of edge length 1 inch. The fluid region is meshed with 22,113 3-D solid Eulerian elements of edg e length 2 inches. The model has 5 different 2-D orthotropic materials, which are used to construct the laminate composites for the shell elements. It also uses an aluminum material for some shell elements. The vents' shell elements are modeled with an e xtremely weak material, so that the inner surface forms a closed volume (required in Dytran). A 3 -D orthotropic material is assigned to the solid Lagrangian elements. Material properties of air are assigned to the Eulerian elements. Generic (unclassified) initial properties are used for the sphere containing the blast wave. A job was run and graphical results were inserted into the final report.",[["53f4cbc7dabfaee57a78192a",null,null,"5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cb83c","Donald A.

In this work we introduce a role-based approach for ad hoc teamwork, in which each teammate is inferred to be following a specialized role that accomplishes a specific task or exhibits a particular behavior. In such cases, the role an ad hoc agent should select depends both on its own capabilities and on the roles currently selected by other team members. We present methods for evaluating the influence of the ad hoc agent's role selection on the team's utility and we examine empirically how to choose the best suited method for role assignment in a complex environment.

For theoretical background, \"the significance of the text - social interaction model\" was used for the analysis conducted in this study, and we classified user generated annotations into three different types. As a result, participants had a tendency to make more annotations about their understanding and appreciation than regarding text interpretation. In addition, the result shows that the social e-book can promote fine-grained interactions.

Indeed, by analyzing brain electrical activity online, several groups have designed brain-actuated systems that provide alternative channels for communication, entertainment and control. Thus, a person can write messages using a virtual keyboard on a computer screen and also browse the internet. Alternatively, subjects can operate simple computer games, or brain games, and interact with educational software. Researchers have also been able to train monkeys to move a computer cursor to desired targets and also to control a robot arm. Work with humans has shown that it is possible for them to move a cursor and even to drive a mobile robot between rooms in a house model. In this talk I will review the field of BCI, with a focus on non-invasive systems based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.

If the goal is to produce completely novel artistic styles, then perhaps other\n reasoning methods offer better opportunities for producing interesting artwork. However, if the goal is to produce new artwork\n that fits a previously-existing style, then it seems to us that CBR is the ideal strategy to use. In this paper we present\n some ideas for integrating CBR with other artificial intelligence techniques in order to generate new artwork that imitates\n a particular artistic style. As an example we show how we have successfully implemented our ideas in a system that produces\n new works of art in the style of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian.

In this paper, we propose a\n user-last method, called Active Duplicate Detection (ADD), where an initial solution is returned without forcing user to specify such parameters and then user is involved to refine\n the initial solution. Different from user-first methods where user makes decision before any processing, ADD allows user to\n make decision based on an initial solution.

The report card is computed for two sets of journals, the top-20 journals in JCR 2010 and the top-20 journals in JCR 2010 for the category Information and Library Science.",[["53f42de5dabfaedf4351d6f1",null,"Judit.Bar-Ilan@biu.ac.il","5b86a5e4e1cd8e14a3d9d2c3","Judit Bar-Ilan",null,null,null,"0000-0002-8796-5248","Department of Information Science, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel 52900",null,"5f71b2ad1c455f439fe3d77c",null,null,null]],"10.1007/s11192-012-0671-3",["World Wide Web","Ranking","Computer science","Report card","Impact factor"],"","0138-9130","2",["Journal report card","Median","90% percentile","Synchronous h-index for journals"],"en",13,"260","249",null,["53e9aafab7602d970347cf44","53e99df0b7602d97026af7d4","53e9b16db7602d9703bf5a4b","53e9b0c2b7602d9703b338af","53e9bc26b7602d970488f163","53e99f0ab7602d97027d873d","53e9a9d3b7602d97033335eb","53e99e80b7602d97027481fa","53e9b5e7b7602d970413abe7","53e99924b7602d970215ec79","53e9b7cdb7602d970437d65c","53e9b9a0b7602d9704590d23"],"Journal report card",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-012-0671-3","http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-012-0671-3","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-012-0671-3","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],["5390acc420f70186a0eb9ddc",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scientometrics",null,null,null,null,0],"92",2012],["5f71b52a1c455f439fe4f3ef","53e997f8b7602d9701ffcbef","The hypergraph augmentation problem is to augment a hypergraph by hyperedges to meet prescribed local connectivity requirements.

This leads naturally to the question, whether one system in such an infinitely entangled state can serve as a resource for tasks like the teleportation of arbitrarily many qubits. We show that appropriate states cannot be obtained by density operators in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. However, using techniques for the description of infinitely many degrees of freedom from field theory and statistical mechanics, such states can nevertheless be constructed rigorously. We explore two related possibilities, namely an extended notion of algebras of observables, and the use of singular states on the algebra of bounded operators.

At this early stage of development, only overall goals of features are understood, and there is a need to discover all possible scenarios of operation. We have developed a formalism - Structured Transition Systems (STS) - that facilitates the rapid evolution of specifications. STS supports multiple idioms of specification : transitions, state-diagrams, scenarios etc. It also supports constructs for hierarchical organization of a specification. We have further defined analyses that are useful for review and inspection of STS specifications. A distinctive feature of our method is the ability to use analysis results to refine and reinforce parts of the specification by importing analysis results into STS specifications. In practice, this leads to a feedback loop where requirements can be rapidly refined using analysis engines to drive the development of requirements. We have experimented using our technique on a number of automotive case-studies, and we present some of our experiences with these case-studies.",[["54302a26dabfaeca69bd07ca",null,null,"5b8698e8e1cd8e14a38325e2","Sampath, P.",null,null,null,null,"India Sci.

It has been argued in the literature that ''a marriage of classical cutting planes and tree search is out of the question as far as the solution of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems is concerned'' [16] because the cuts generated at one node of the search tree need not be valid at other nodes. We show that it is possible, by using a simple lifting procedure, to make Gomory cuts generated at a node of the enumeration tree globally valid in the case of mixed 0-1 programs. The procedure essentially amounts to treating the variables fixed at 0 or 1 as if they were free. We also show why this lifting procedure is not valid for general (other than 0-1) mixed integer programs. Other issues addressed in the paper are of a computational nature, such as strategies for generating the cutting planes, deciding between branching and cutting, etc. The result is a robust mixed integer program solver.",[["53f48444dabfaec09f2a69bb",null,null,"5b86ad3de1cd8e14a3096f9d","E.

SVD is powerful at finding the global solution to the associated least-square-error minimization problem. However, this is the correct error to minimize only when the x and y positional errors in the features are uncorrelated and identically distributed. But this is rarely the case in real data. Uncertainty in feature position depends on the underlying spatial intensity structure in the image, which has strong directionality to it. Hence, the proper measure to minimize is covariance-weighted squared-error (or the Mahalanobis distance). In this paper, we describe a new approach to covariance-weighted factorization, which can factor noisy feature correspondences with high degree of directional uncertainty into structure and motion. Our approach is based on transforming the raw-data into a covariance-weighted data space, where the components of noise in the different directions are uncorrelated and identically distributed. Applying SVD to the transformed data now minimizes a meaningful objective function in this new data space. This is followed by a linear but suboptimal second step to recover the shape and motion in the original data space. We empirically show that our algorithm gives very good results for varying degrees of directional uncertainty. In particular, we show that unlike other SVD-based factorization algorithms, our method does not degrade with increase in directionality of uncertainty, even in the extreme when only normal-flow data is available. It thus provides a unified approach for treating corner-like points together with points along linear structures in the image.",[["54406eaadabfae805a6bd3ad",null,null,"5b8694a4e1cd8e14a367346f","P.

The prime motivation is to show that functional programming languages are useful in software engineering practice. All kinds of systems, either with or without a state, can be modelled in a simple way. An attempt is made to devise executable models that are amenable to mathematical proofs. Apart from testing, proving is a viable technique for establishing correctness of algorithms. There exists a clear link to systems theory. Some restrictions have to be imposed on systems theory to obtain executability, but these restrictions are fewer than assumed normally when systems are described in imperative programming languages. As a consequence, an executable specification language is obtained. The well known `functional specs' can be written in a purely functional programming language.

In some applications, like spam detection, false positive errors are serious problems. In other applications, like medical diagnosis, abstaining from making a prediction may be more desirable than making an incorrect prediction. In this paper we consider different types of reliable classifiers suited for such situations. We formalize the notion and study properties of reliable classifiers in the spirit of agnostic learning (Haussler, 1992; Kearns, Schapire, and Sellie, 1994), a PAC-like model where no assumption is made on the function being learned. We then give two algorithms for reliable agnostic learning under natural distributions. The first reliably learns DNFs with no false positives using membership queries. The second reliably learns halfspaces from random examples with no false positives or false negatives, but the classifier sometimes abstains from making predictions.",[["53f49d50dabfaebfa677b67a",null,"adum@microsoft.com","5b86ca91e1cd8e14a3db52c6","Adam Tauman Kalai",null,null,null,null,"Microsoft Research, Cambridge, MA, USA",null,"5f71b2831c455f439fe3c634",["Microsoft Research, Cambridge, MA, USA","Part of this research was done while the author was at Georgia Institute of Technology, supported in part by NSF SES-0734780, and NSF CAREER award, and a SLOAN Fellowship."],null,null],["53f42feadabfaee02ac80b39",null,"vkanade@fas.harvard.edu","5b86cf65e1cd8e14a3feabb2","Varun Kanade",null,null,null,"0000-0002-2300-4819","School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA",null,"5f71b4501c455f439fe491ff",["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","Corresponding author.","This research was done while the author was at Georgia Institute of Technology, supported in part by NSF CCF-0746550."],null,null],["53f4bcb4dabfaeda9b77b79d",null,"mansour@tau.ac.il","5b86b6d3e1cd8e14a34d2759","Yishay Mansour",null,null,null,null,"School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel",null,"5f71b28d1c455f439fe3ca38",["School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel","This work was supported in part by the IST Programme of the European Community, under the PASCAL2 Network of Excellence, by a grant from the Israel Science Foundation and by a grant from United States‚ÄìIsrael Binational Science Foundation (BSF).

The interactions are described by value passing; the mode of communication (i.e., whether the value is passed over a channel or kept as shared data, etc.) is left unspecified.\n ",[["54087a3ddabfae450f41e87c",null,null,"5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598","William Cook",null,null,null,null,"The University of Texas at Austin",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf",null,null,null],["53f56fa3dabfae75cdf8047d",null,null,"5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598","Jayadev Misra",null,null,null,null,"The University of Texas at Austin",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf",null,null,null]],"10.1007/978-3-540-89437-7_9",["Transaction processing","Concurrency","Computer science","Communication channel","SOAP","Web service","Workflow","Orchestration (computing)","Computation","Distributed computing"],"","","",["communication failure","concurrent program","concurrency focus","concurrent system","structured interacting computations","client-server system","value passing","desktop application","controlled fashion","expressive power","guiding principle","transaction processing","web service","client server"],"en",19,"145","139","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e9981db7602d970203a03f_0.pdf",["53e99822b7602d9702044a99","53e9b587b7602d97040c828b","53e99808b7602d970201a17e","53e9af26b7602d97039639a9","53e9ab69b7602d97035075e8"],"Structured Interacting Computations",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-89437-7_9"],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"",2008],["5f71b3dc1c455f439fe45dc3","53e9981db7602d970203a9b1","In queueing theory, it has been known for a long time that the scheduling policy used in a system greatly impacts user-perceived performance. For example, it has been proven in the 1960's that size-based scheduling policies that give priority to short jobs are optimal with respect to mean response time. Yet, virtually no systems today implement these policies. One reason is that real systems are significantly more complex than a theoretical M/M/1 or M/G/1 queue and it is not obvious how to implement some of these policies in practice. Another reason is that there is a fear that the big jobs will \"starve\", or be treated unfairly as compared to Processor-Sharing (PS). In this article we show, using two important real world applications, that size-based scheduling can be used in practice to greatly improve mean response times in real systems, without causing unfairness or starvation.

Several interesting results have also been shown for SSI form concerning liveness analysis and the representation of live-ranges of variables, which could make SSI form appealing for just-in-time compilation. Unfortunately, we have uncovered several mistakes in the previous literature on SSI form, which, admittedly, is already quite sparse. This article corrects the mistakes that are most germane to SSI form. We first explain why the two definitions of SSI form proposed in past literature, first by C. S. Ananian, then by J. Singer, are not equivalent. Our main result is then to prove that basic blocks, and thus program points, can be totally ordered so that live-ranges of variables correspond to intervals on a line, a result that holds for both variants of SSI form. In other words, in SSI form, the intersection graph defined by live-ranges is an interval graph, a stronger structural property than for SSA form for which the intersection graph of live-ranges is chordal. Finally, we show how this structure of live-ranges can be used to simplify liveness analysis.",[["53f4464adabfaee1c0aec34f",null,"benoit.boissinot@ens-lyon.org","5b86b6eae1cd8e14a34dd431","Benoit Boissinot",null,null,null,null,"ENS-Lyon",null,"5f71b29a1c455f439fe3d033",["UCB Lyon 1, ENS Lyon, CNRS, UMR,LIP,Compsys Team,Inria 5668, Lyon, France"],null,null],["54058678dabfae92b41dfd75",null,null,"5b86c411e1cd8e14a3ac7a9e","Philip Brisk",null,null,null,"0000-0003-0083-9781","University of California, Riverside",null,"5f71b2931c455f439fe3ccff",["Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA"],null,null],["53f352a6dabfae4b3494ef01",null,null,"5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cb8ce","Alain Darte",null,null,null,null,"CNRS",null,"5f71b28c1c455f439fe3c9b4",["UCB Lyon 1, ENS Lyon, CNRS, UMR,LIP,Compsys Team,Inria 5668, Lyon, France"],null,null],["53f4c98adabfaee9caf80708",null,null,"5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca1e9","Fabrice Rastello",null,null,null,null,"Inria",null,"5f71b29a1c455f439fe3d023",["UCB Lyon 1, ENS Lyon, CNRS, UMR,LIP,Compsys Team,Inria 5668, Lyon, France"],null,null]],"10.1145/2180887.2180898",["Interval graph","Control flow graph","Computer science","Chordal graph","Algorithm","Theoretical computer science","Compiler","Intersection graph","Intermediate language","Static single assignment form","Liveness"],"","1539-9087","1",["past literature","main result","interval graph","ssi form","liveness analysis","previous literature","ssa form","numerous compiler analysis","interesting result","ssi properties revisited","intersection graph","static single assignment","intermediate representation","control flow graph","total order","just in time compiler"],"en",12,"ArticleNo.21","ArticleNo.21",null,["53e9ba4ab7602d970465f31f","53e9aee5b7602d9703913955","599c7f1c601a182cd28ef2d1","53e99a85b7602d97022f8854","53e9bd76b7602d9704a1696e","53e9bbd5b7602d9704827fa0","53e9b2d2b7602d9703d808fa","53e99d87b7602d97026424cc","53e9ad48b7602d970372e86e","53e9b2f4b7602d9703db13ce","53e9ac5bb7602d970362911b","53e9a914b7602d970326534d","53e9a051b7602d9702936edd","53e9a539b7602d9702e5eef4","53e9aeaab7602d97038cbf42","53e9a81fb7602d97031681bc","53e9a317b7602d9702c1eb91","53e9a699b7602d9702fcd99d","53e9bd92b7602d9704a39950","53e9b394b7602d9703e75b90","53e99b04b7602d9702393a8c","53e9a97bb7602d97032d6747"],"SSI Properties Revisited",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2180887.2180898","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2180887.2180898","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],["555036cf7cea80f954158d34",null,null,null,null,null,null,"ACM Trans.

In order to improve the efficiency of constraint solving, techniques that learn during search, such as constraint weighting\n and nogood learning, have been proposed. Constraint weights can be used to guide heuristic choices. Nogood assignments can\n be avoided by adding additional constraints. Both of these techniques can be used in either one-shot systematic search, or\n in a setting in which we frequently restart the search procedure. In this paper we propose a third way of learning during\n search, generalising previous work by Freuder and Hubbe. Specifically, we show how, in a restart context, we can guarantee\n that we avoid revisiting a previously visited region of the search space by extracting it from the problem. Likewise, we can\n avoid revisiting inconsistent regions of the search space by extracting inconsistent subproblems, based on a significant improvement\n upon Freuder and Hubbe‚Äôs approach. A major empirical result of this paper is that our approach significantly outperforms \n\n\n\n\n\n mac\\mbox{\\sc mac} combined with weighted degree heuristics and restarts on challenging constraint problems. Our approach can be regarded as\n an efficient form of learning that does not rely on constraint propagation. Instead, we rely on a reformulation of a csp into an equivalent set of csps, none of which contain any of the search space we wish to avoid.\n ",[["5434f816dabfaebba588769b",null,"d.mehta@4c.ucc.ie","5b86b4d0e1cd8e14a33e7f8f","Deepak Mehta",null,null,null,null,"University College Cork Cork Constraint Computation Centre Department of Computer Science Ireland",null,"5f71b2bc1c455f439fe3de48",null,null,null],["5601b96145cedb3395ea4cd3",null,"b.osullivan@4c.ucc.ie","5b86b4d0e1cd8e14a33e7f8f","Barry O‚ÄôSullivan",null,null,null,null,"University College Cork Cork Constraint Computation Centre Department of Computer Science Ireland",null,"5f71b2bc1c455f439fe3de48",null,null,null],["53f3b0d9dabfae4b34b1b19a",null,"l.quesada@4c.ucc.ie","5b86b4d0e1cd8e14a33e7f8f","Luis Quesada",null,null,null,null,"University College Cork Cork Constraint Computation Centre Department of Computer Science Ireland",null,"5f71b2bc1c455f439fe3de48",null,null,null],["53f7c3d5dabfae8faa4b1f27",null,"n.wilson@4c.ucc.ie","5b86b4d0e1cd8e14a33e7f8f","Nic Wilson",null,null,null,null,"University College Cork Cork Constraint Computation Centre Department of Computer Science Ireland",null,"5f71b2bc1c455f439fe3de48",null,null,null]],"10.1007/978-3-642-04244-7_48",["Constraint satisfaction","Local consistency","Mathematical optimization","Min-conflicts algorithm","Constraint satisfaction problem","Constraint learning","Constraint logic programming","Mathematics","Binary constraint","Hybrid algorithm (constraint satisfaction)"],"3-642-04243-0","","",["search space extraction","constraint propagation","constraint weighting","search space","constraint weight","additional constraint","one-shot systematic search","nogood learning","systematic tree search","search procedure","constraint problem","constraint satisfaction problem"],"en",4,"622","608","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99822b7602d9702042a81_0.pdf",["53e9a424b7602d9702d42d82","53e9af81b7602d97039c400a","53e99a2fb7602d970228c0d6","53e9aa3bb7602d97033aac0d","53e9acbdb7602d970369ceb0","53e9b3fdb7602d9703eecb20","53e99afeb7602d970238ddf5","558a65a484ae84d265bd5d3e","53e99a78b7602d97022e8b73","53e9a87eb7602d97031cb12e","53e9a48eb7602d9702dafc01"],"Search Space Extraction",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04244-7_48"],["53e18c4420f7dfbc07e9008d",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming",null,null,null,null,2],"",2009],["5f71b2c51c455f439fe3e23e","53e99822b7602d9702043393","\n I will first sketch some background on the company ScanSoft.

To remedy this, combinatorial auctions permit bids on bundles of goods.

It attempts to minimize the probability of disruptive pauses by careful scheduling of scavenges. Scavenge pauses are hidden in pauses created by the running program or by the user; they are also shortened by scheduling them at low points in the stack height, where live data tend to be at a minimum. These heuristics can be surprisingly simple and cheap to implement --- user input primitives provide an effective hook from which to invoke the scheduling routine, since they tend to correspond both to local stack minima and to computational pause boundaries.An additional mechanism is proposed to detect times when it is safe to scavenge an intermediate generation, based on the amount of data surviving from a new-generation scavenge.

Such approaches raise the need for a unified theory that would ease their combination, but would also outline the scope of what can be expected in terms of engineering to put model manipulation into action. In this work, we address this problem from the model substitutability point of view, through model typing. We introduce four mechanisms to achieve model substitutability, each formally defined by a subtyping relation. We then discuss how to declare and check these subtyping relations. This work provides a formal reference specification establishing a family of model-oriented type systems. These type systems enable many facilities that are well known at the programming language level.

Well-known examples include the kernel density estimate (KDE) for density estimation and the support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We propose a kernel classifier that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a \"difference of densities.\" We focus on the Gaussian kernel, although the method applies to other kernels suitable for density estimation. Like a support vector machine (SVM), the classifier is sparse and results from solving a quadratic program. We provide statistical performance guarantees for the proposed L2 kernel classifier in the form of a finite sample oracle inequality and strong consistency in the sense of both ISE and probability of error. A special case of our analysis applies to a previously introduced ISE-based method for kernel density estimation. For dimensionality greater than 15, the basic L2 kernel classifier performs poorly in practice. Thus, we extend the method through the introduction of a natural regularization parameter, which allows it to remain competitive with the SVM in high dimensions.

Firstly, we formalise the mixing problem and provide both analytical and heuris- tic approaches to solving it. The analytical approaches are shown to not scale well with the number of local models, but are nevertheless compared to heuristic models in a set of function approximation tasks. These experiments show that we can design heuristics that exceed the performance of the current state-of-the-art Learning Classifier System XCS, and are competitive when compared to analytical solutions. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the prediction errors for the heuristic mixing approaches.

Deductive verification is carried out by constructing a proof that the program satisfies its specification, whereas model checking uses state exploration to find computations where the property fails. Model checking is largely automatic but is effective only for programs defined over small state spaces. Abstraction serves as a bridge between the more general deductive methods for program verification and the restricted but effective state exporation methods used in model checking. In verification by abstraction, deduction is used to construct a finite-state approximation of a program that preserves the property of interest. The resulting abstraction can be explored for offending computations through the use of model checking.

In contrast to previous work, we do not assume that F is convex, and in fact make no assumptions at all about F. By necessity this means that we work in the property testing model; we seek an algorithm which, given parameters A and Œµ, satisfies: ‚Ä¢ if surf (F) ‚â§ A then the algorithm accepts (whp); ‚Ä¢ if F is not Œµ-close to some set G with surf (G) ‚â§ Œ∫A, then the algorithm rejects (whp). We call Œ∫ ‚â• 1 the \\\"approximation factor\\\" of the testing algorithm. The n = 1 case (in which \\\"surf(F) = 2m\\\" means F is a disjoint union of m intervals) was introduced by Kearns and Ron [KR98], who solved the problem with Œ∫ = 1/Œµ and O(1/Œµ) oracle queries. Later, Balcan et al. [BBBY12] solved it with with Œ∫ = 1 and O(1/Œµ4) queries. We give the first result for higher dimensions n. Perhaps surprisingly, our algorithm completely evades the \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\": for any n and any Œ∫ > 4/œÄ &ap; 1.27 we give a test that uses O(1/Œµ) queries.

These approaches shortened the distance between the artificial and the natural mind by stressing the importance of the unity between the brain, the body and the environment. At the same time, nowadays robotic researchers openly acknowledge the importance of experience which has been not sufficiently considered in the recent past. The process went so far that the field of machine consciousness is now part of the scientific landscape. The externalist approach identifies experience with relations, processes or acts between an agent and its environment. Externalism is the view according to which the brain and its neural activity is necessary but not sufficient to produce the conscious mind. The externalist approach locates the subject and experience processes in a context wider than brain-oriented approaches. Because of this fact, the externalist standpoints allows to start from methodological and ontological premises suitable for the study of experience and of other subjective contents inside an experimental framework. The talk will review the externalist-oriented approaches and it will present the main ideas at the basis of the emerging field of externalist robotics.

We describe how a hierarchical dynamical model of motor function is able to solve the problem of delayed reward in learning movement sequences using associative (Hebbian) learning. At the lowest level, the motor system encodes simple movements or primitives, while at higher levels the system encodes sequences of primitives. During training, the network is able to learn a high level motor program composed of a specific temporal sequence of motor primitives. The network is able to achieve this despite the fact that the reward signal, which indicates whether or not the desired motor program has been performed correctly, is received only at the end of each trial during learning. Use of a continuous attractor network in the architecture enables the network to generate the motor outputs required to produce the continuous movements necessary to implement the motor sequence.",[["53f4398edabfaec22ba9edc8",null,null,"5b869097e1cd8e14a34d0bf8","S.

However, the use and development of cloud services has not been standardized, thereby deriving in migratability and interoperability difficulties. Different standardization initiatives exist seeking to normalize this situation, however none has predominated and a generalized consensus has not been reached. Consequently, several alternatives have been proposed based on the use of intermediate layers or middlewares seeking to isolate developers from the variability of specific cloud vendor services. These approaches provide a valid solution at the risk of shifting the lock-in effect from vendors to middlewares. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution based on the use of software adaptation (SA) techniques.

The accurate measure of trust and reputation is a hard problem, most of the existing trust mechanisms adopt the historical behavior feedback to compute trust and reputation. Thus exploring the appropriate transaction behavior becomes a fundamental challenge. In P2P system, each peer plays two roles: server and client with responsibility for providing resource service and trust recommending respectively. Considering the resource service behavior and trust recommending behavior of each peer, in this paper, we propose a new trust model adopting the technology to calculate eigenvectors of trust rating and recommending matrices. In our model, we define recommended reputation value to evaluate the resource service behavior, and recommending reputation value to evaluate the trust recommendation behavior. Our algorithm would make these two reputation values established an interrelated relation of reinforcing mutually. The normal peers provide authentic file uploading services, as well as give correct trust recommendation, so they can form a trusted and cooperative transaction community via the mutual reinforcement of recommended and recommending reputation values. In this way, the transaction behaviors of those malicious peers are isolated and confined effectively. Extensive experimental results also confirm the efficiency of our trust model against the threats of exaggeration, collusion, disguise, sybil and single-behavior.",[["53f45045dabfaee2a1d5bc9f",null,"xinxinyuanfan@gmail.com","5b869cc2e1cd8e14a39de7dd","Xinxin Fan",null,null,null,null,"School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116620, Liaoning, PR China",null,"5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e34f",["School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116620, Liaoning, PR China","Corresponding author.

Assuming that the nodes' forward channels are not known, the following three relay selection schemes are proposed and their performances are analyzed. 1) Optimal relay selection scheme that maximizes the average SNR at the receiver by exploiting K nodes with the highest SNRs as relays; 2) geometry-based relay selection scheme that is energy-efficient and achieves a close-to-optimal average SNR performance at the receiver by using K closest nodes to the source as relays; and 3) random relay selection scheme that is energy-efficient and further guarantees a fair usage of all nodes by randomly selecting K relays from a specific area around the source.

Furthermore, four evaluation criteria, viz. assembly angle, assembly direction, reorientation, and stability, and related algorithms are defined for evaluating the assembly's complexity. For selecting the optimal sequence, a comprehensive evaluation function is constructed by integrating the four criteria and the weights are quantitatively allocated referring to fuzzy set theory, clustering analysis, and entropy theory.

One of the significant features in modern networks is differentiated service. Along with differentiated service, rapidly changing network environments result in congestion problems. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of representative congestion control applications - scheduling and queue management algorithms, and we propose application-specific acceleration technique using ILP (instruction level parallelism) and PLP (packet level parallelism). From the ILP perspective, new instruction set extensions for fast conditional operations are applied for congestion control applications. Based on our experiments, proposed architectural extensions show 10-12% improvement in performance for instruction set enhancements. For PLP, we propose a hardware acceleration model based on detailed analysis of congestion control applications. In order to get large throughputs, large number of processing elements and a parallel comparator are designed. Such hardware accelerators provide large parallelism proportional to the number of processing elements added. As the performance of general purpose processors rapidly increases, defining architectural extensions (e.g., MMX as in multimedia applications) for general purpose processors could be an alternative solution for wide range of network applications.",[["53f43011dabfaedd74d58838",null,null,"5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598","Byeong Kil Lee",null,null,null,null,"The University of Texas at Austin",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf",null,null,null],["53f45a7cdabfaeb2ac0e55a4",null,null,"5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598","Lizy Kurian John",null,null,null,null,"The University of Texas at Austin",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf",null,null,null],["53f43adadabfaeee229d5cf5",null,null,"5b86c1e8e1cd8e14a39d25fe","Eugene John",null,null,null,null,"The University of Texas at San Antonio",null,"5f71b2ca1c455f439fe3e48a",null,null,null]],"10.1109/ASAP.2005.16",["Instruction-level parallelism","Network service","Network processor","Computer architecture","Instruction set","Computer science","Network packet","Differentiated service","Hardware acceleration","Network congestion","Distributed computing"],"0-7695-2407-9","2160-0511","",["intelligent network application","congestion control","processor scheduling","parallel processing","diffserv networks","network application","scheduling","application-specific acceleration","instruction set extension","network service","modern network","differentiated service","telecommunication congestion control","queueing theory","various network service","instruction level parallelism","network processor","packet level parallelism","general purpose processor","hardware acceleration model","complex network protocol","queue management","architectural support","instruction sets","network processors","congestion problem","accelerating congestion control applications","modern intelligent network application","network environments result","congestion control application","network protocol","intelligent networks","process capability","hardware accelerator","protocols","bandwidth","intelligent network","acceleration","complex networks","communication networks","scheduling algorithm","hardware","complex network","control systems"],"en",3,"175","169",null,["53e9a5fdb7602d9702f28db6","53e9ab5fb7602d97034f6cd5","53e9a38fb7602d9702ca0479","53e9b421b7602d9703f16c73","53e9af53b7602d9703994625","53e9b891b7602d9704467c85","558ac59c84ae84d265bf8c38","53e9ba54b7602d970466fb7b","53e99960b7602d97021a5260","573695d86e3b12023e4efe49","558a355184ae84d265bc3c70","53e9a7d5b7602d9703111f81"],"Architectural support for accelerating congestion control applications in network processors",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2005.16","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ASAP.2005.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1540382"],["5550373b7cea80f95417ae04",null,null,"Application-Specific Systems, Architectures, and Processors",null,null,null,"ASAP",null,null,null,null,0],"",2005],["34359744218","53e99866b7602d970209e337","We describe an action planning approach that integrates a system of autonomous dialogue engines with narration and presentation modules to create a multi-modal storytelling environment.

Therefore, it becomes essential to study the behavior of multiprocessor architectures under commercial workloads. To accomplish this, we need simulators able to model not only the CPU, memory and interconnection network but also other aspects that are critical in the execution of commercial workloads, such as I/O subsystem and operating system. In this paper, we present our first experiences using Simics, a simulator which allows full-system simulation of multiprocessor architectures covering all the topics previously mentioned. Using Simics we carry out a detailed performance study of a static web content server, showing how changes in some architectural parameters, such as number of processors and cache size, affect final performance. The results we have obtained corroborate the intuition of increasing performance of a dual-processor web server opposite to a single-processor one, and at the same time, allow us to check out Simics limitations.

The results of this research on combining\n two biometric modalities demonstrate a considerable amount of improvement in EER (Equal Error Rate) and ROC (Receiver Operating\n Characteristic) curves than single-mode biometric systems.\n \n ",[[null,null,"kanghyosup@krpost.net","5b86c368e1cd8e14a3a7b586","H.

Software changes can alter software power consumption behaviour and can cause power performance regressions. By tracking software power consumption we can build models to provide suggestions to avoid power regressions. There is much research on software power consumption, but little focus on the relationship between software changes and power consumption. Most work measures the power consumption of a single software task; instead we seek to extend this work across the history (revisions) of a project. We develop a set of tests for a well established product and then run those tests across all versions of the product while recording the power usage of these tests. We provide and demonstrate a methodology that enables the analysis of power consumption performance for over 500 nightly builds of Firefox 3.6; we show that software change does induce changes in power consumption. This methodology and case study are a first step towards combining power measurement and mining software repositories research, thus enabling developers to avoid power regressions via power consumption awareness. \n\n",[["53f37a88dabfae4b349e0daa",null,null,"5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c9ecb","Abram Hindle",null,null,null,null,"University of Alberta, Canada",null,"5f71b2941c455f439fe3cd7c",null,null,null]],"10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227094",["Software changes","Software engineering","Industrial engineering","Popularity","Software","Power demand","Engineering","Power performance","Power usage","Power consumption","Mining software repositories"],"978-1-4673-1067-3","","",["data mining","environmental factors","power aware computing","power consumption","software engineering","Firefox 3.6","cloud-computing","green mining","mobile-computing","power regressions","smart-phones","software engineers","software power consumption behaviour","software repositories research","dynamic analysis","mining software repositories","power","power consumption","sustainable-software"],"en",31,"1304","1301","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99885b7602d97020c0328_0.pdf",["53e9ae22b7602d9703835c65","558ac9cbe4b031bae1f9add1","53e9a569b7602d9702e92a59","53e9b97cb7602d9704568f54","53e99df7b7602d97026b83d8","53e9b70fb7602d97042a8042","53e99d80b7602d970263ca8a","53e9a8dbb7602d970322a634","53e9aaf3b7602d9703476bfa"],"Green mining: investigating power consumption across versions",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6227094","https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2337223.2337401"],["53a72c4020f7420be8c3da37",null,null,null,null,null,null,"ICSE",null,null,null,null,0],"2",2012],["5f71b2901c455f439fe3cb6d","53e99885b7602d97020c1366","Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in content-based web applications, from news to shopping sites.

This paper focuses on the news domain, and proposes to enhance effectiveness of news recommender systems by adding, to each recommendation, an explanatory statement to help the user to better understand if, and why, the item can be her interest. We consider the news recommender system as a black-box, and generate different types of explanations employing pieces of information associated with the news. In particular, we engineer text-based, entity-based, and usage-based explanations, and make use of a Markov Logic Networks to rank the explanations on the basis of their effectiveness. The assessment of the model is conducted via a user study on a dataset of news read consecutively by actual users.

However, the cost of expert annotation of relevant data, coupled with issues of inter-annotator variability, makes it expensive and time-consuming to create the necessary corpora. We report here on a simple method for the automatic creation of large quantities of imperfect training data for a biological entity (gene or protein) extraction system. We used resources available in the FlyBase model organism database; these resources include a curated lists of genes and the articles from which the entries were drawn, together a synonym lexicon. We applied simple pattern matching to identify gene names in the associated abstracts and filtered these entities using the list of curated entries for the article.

Since the closed-form solution of this optimum estimator is not readily available, we alternatively derive closed-form expressions for an upper and a lower bound on the desired estimator. Using these bounds, we propose a new family of speech enhancement estimators that are characterized by a scalar parameter 0 ‚â§ Œ≥ ‚â§ 1, with Œ≥ = 0 corresponding to the lower bound and Œ≥ = 1 to the upper bound.

Information such as output probabilities, the overall probability of error, and signal observability can then be extracted from the circuit PTM. We employ algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) to improve the efficiency of PTM operations. A particularly challenging technical problem, solved in our work, is to simultaneously extend tensor products and matrix multiplication in terms of ADDs to non-square matrices. Our PTM-based method enables accurate evaluation of reliability for moderately large circuits and can be extended by circuit partitioning.

The platform exhibits the notion of a site as one of its main abstractions. A site is a collection of workstations, media input, and output devices that are, in terms of control, tightly coupled. Connection and application control is centralized within one site, but distributed among different sites. The platform exports a programming interface with high-level abstractions for session and connection control, allowing application developers to concentrate on scenario and user interface design. The platform was implemented in the course of the European Beteus (Broadband Exchange for Trans-European Usage) project. A tele-meeting application and a tele-teaching application were developed on top of it. Platform components and applications were tested on the European asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) pilot network over a period of nine months.

The array gain gives information on the power offset that results from exploiting channel state information at the transmitter or as a consequence of the channel model. Hence, the diversity, multiplexing, and array gain (DMA) analysis is able to cope with the limitations of the original DMT and provide an operational meaning in the sense that the DMA gains of a particular system can be directly translated into a parameterized characterization of its associated outage probability performance. In this paper, we derive the best DMA gains achievable by any scheme employing isotropic signaling in uncorrelated Rayleigh, semicorrelated Rayleigh, and uncorrelated Rician block-fading MIMO channels. We use these results to analyze the effect of important channel parameters on the outage performance at different points of the DMT curve.",[["53f4c818dabfaee57677cfe7","Luis G.

Bringing a given object into focus is however a long and tedious task, although the underlying optical laws are known. A fundamental parameter is the aperture of the lens entrance pupil because it directly affects the depth of field. The smaller the aperture, the larger the depth of field. However a too small aperture destroys the sharpness of the image because of diffraction on the pupil edges. Hence, the desired optimal configuration of the camera is such that the object is in focus with the greatest possible lens aperture. In this paper, we show that when the object is a convex polyhedron, an elegant solution to this problem can be found.

In the US, a great deal of effort has been devoted to statistically recording detailed performance characteristics of major league professional baseball. Every year there has been two to four seasonal competitions, with known outcome in terms of the proportion of contests won. Successful teams often have diverse characteristics, emphasizing different characteristics. SMART, PROMETHEE, and a centroid method were applied to baseball data over the period 1901‚Äì1991. Baseball has undergone a series of changes in style over that period, and different physical and administrative characteristics. Therefore the data was divided into decades, with the first five years used as a training set, and the last five years used for data collection. Regression was used to develop the input for preference selection in each method. Single-attribute utilities for criteria performance were generated from the first five years of data from each set. Relative accuracy of multicriteria methods was compared over 114 competitive seasons for both selecting the winning team, as well as for rank-ordering all teams.

In VCD, a vehicle opportunistically communicates with nearby access points (APs) to download the content of interest. To fully take advantage of such transient contact with APs, we proactively push content to the APs that the vehicles will likely visit in the near future. In this way, vehicles can enjoy the full wireless capacity instead of being bottle-necked by the Internet connectivity, which is either slow or even unavailable. We develop a new algorithm for predicting the APs that will soon be visited by the vehicles. We then develop a replication scheme that leverages the synergy among (i) Internet connectivity (which is persistent but has limited coverage and low bandwidth), (ii) local wireless connectivity (which has high bandwidth but transient duration), (iii) vehicular relay connectivity (which has high bandwidth but high delay), and (iv) mesh connectivity among APs (which has high bandwidth but low coverage). We demonstrate the effectiveness of VCD system using trace-driven simulation and Emulab emulation based on real taxi traces.

The measurement of white matter structure and features of the cortical surface can help define biomarkers that predict this risk. The measurement of these structures relies upon accurate automated segmentation routines, but these are often confounded by neonatal-specific imaging difficulties including poor contrast, low resolution, partial volume effects and the presence of significant natural and pathological anatomical variability. In this work we develop and evaluate an adaptive preterm multi-modal maximum a posteriori expectation-maximisation segmentation algorithm (AdaPT) incorporating an iterative relaxation strategy that adapts the tissue proportion priors toward the subject data. Also incorporated are intensity non-uniformity correction, a spatial homogeneity term in the form of a Markov random field and furthermore, the proposed method explicitly models the partial volume effect specifically mitigating the neonatal specific grey and white matter contrast inversion. Spatial priors are iteratively relaxed, enabling the segmentation of images with high anatomical disparity from a normal population. Experiments performed on a clinical cohort of 92 infants are validated against manual segmentation of normal and pathological cortical grey matter, cerebellum and ventricular volumes. Dice overlap scores increase significantly when compared to a widely-used maximum likelihood expectation maximisation algorithm for pathological cortical grey matter, cerebellum and ventricular volumes. Adaptive maximum a posteriori expectation maximisation is shown to be a useful tool for accurate and robust neonatal brain segmentation.",[["53f42669dabfaeb22f3c53ff",null,null,null,"Manuel Jorge Cardoso",null,null,null,"0000-0003-1284-2558","Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK",null,null,["Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK","The first two authors contributed equally to this work."],null,null],["53f44c0fdabfaee2a1d4b8e8",null,"a.melbourne@ucl.ac.uk",null,"Andrew Melbourne",null,null,null,"0000-0001-7667-3947","Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK",null,null,["Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK","Corresponding author.","The first two authors contributed equally to this work."],null,null],["53f3ac4ddabfae4b34aff2e4",null,null,null,"Giles S.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the list of Web 2.0 services and their mashups that is provided on Programmableweb, a network of Web 2.0 services was constructed. Within this network a node represents a Web 2.0 service with an open API, and a link between two nodes represents the existence of a mashup service that uses the two nodes. Findings - The findings suggest that the evolution of the Web 2.0 service network; follows the preferential attachment rule although the exponent of the preferential attachment is lower than for other networks following a preferential attachment rule. Additionally the results indicate that the Web 2.0 service network evolves to a scale-free network but the exponent of the power law distribution is lower than for other networks. Originality/value - The research applied social network analysis to the Web 2.0 service network. It showed that its network structure and the evolution mechanism are different from those found in similar areas, e.g. the world wide web (WWW). The findings imply that there are factors which lower the exponent of the preferential attachment equation and the power law distribution of the degree centralities. Research limitation/implications - This paper did not investigate the factors responsible for the low values of the exponent of the preferential attachment equation and the exponent of the power law distribution. However, it is suggested that it could be correlated with the fact that the interconnection between nodes depends on the property of the nodes.",[["54088710dabfae450f424b6f",null,null,null,"Junseok Hwang",null,null,null,null,"Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea",null,null,["Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea"],null,null],["540677d4dabfae44f0835781",null,null,null,"J√∂rn Altmann",null,null,null,null,"Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea",null,null,["Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea"],null,null],["53f438a8dabfaeecd6974184",null,"kibae36@snu.ac.kr",null,"Kibae Kim",null,null,null,"0000-0002-4798-9114","Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea",null,null,["Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea"],null,null]],"10.1108/14684520911010990",["Network formation","Mashup","World Wide Web","Social network","Computer science","Social network analysis","Web 2.0","Web service","Preferential attachment","The Internet"],"","1468-4527","6.0",["Worldwide web","Internet","Social networks","Computer communications software"],"en",45,"1057.0","1040.0",null,["53e9a525b7602d9702e49a30","53e9a711b7602d97030482c4","53e9af40b7602d970397c5cb","53e9a952b7602d97032a4cd1","53e9bbe5b7602d97048387d0","53e9b4d4b7602d9703ff7208","53e9b010b7602d9703a689ee","53e99b63b7602d9702409c11","53e9ac82b7602d97036551c3","53e9a082b7602d970296ce1b","53e9abaab7602d9703554dbd"],"The structural evolution of the Web 2.0 service network",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/14684520911010990","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],[null,"1468-4527",null,null,null,"1468-4535",null,"ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW",null,"ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW",null,"J",null],"33.0",2009],["5f71b2c01c455f439fe3e01f","53e998b8b7602d97020ee442","",[["53f428d0dabfaeb22f3d1b61",null,null,"5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c9efa","Sebastian Haufe",null,null,null,null,"dresden university of technology",null,"5f71b2c01c455f439fe3e01f",null,null,null],["53f42e14dabfaee4dc722a68",null,null,"5b86c1e4e1cd8e14a39d0624","Michael Thielscher",null,null,null,null,"university of new south wales",null,"5f71b28c1c455f439fe3c9bd",null,null,null]],"",["Combinatorial game theory","Game mechanics","Computer science","Theoretical computer science","Simulations and games in economics education","General game playing","Artificial intelligence","Sequential game","Screening game","Epistemology","Answer set programming","Mathematical game"],"","","",["automated reasoning","answer set programming"],"en",3,"","","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e998b8b7602d97020ee442_0.pdf",["53e9aabdb7602d970343ac7f","53e9a7a5b7602d97030e0d60","53e9be4ab7602d9704b09fa0","53e9a832b7602d970317989a","53e9a26ab7602d9702b6f0ff","53e9abdab7602d970358fec1","53e9b49bb7602d9703fa7b55","53e9b82fb7602d97043eb154","53e99f5db7602d97028314fa","53e9b6b0b7602d970423431f","53e9b3efb7602d9703ede322","5c78053d4895d9cbc6732758","53e9afdab7602d9703a2ccce","5c77961e4895d9cbc62a78d9","56d8680edabfae2eeeb01bc6"],"Automated Verification of Epistemic Properties for General Game Playing.",["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/KR/KR12/paper/view/4486"],["555037777cea80f954188e5d",null,null,"Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning",null,null,null,"KR",null,null,null,null,0],"",2012],["5f71b2fa1c455f439fe3f934","53e998b0b7602d97020ee200","The geographical routing suffers from communication voids in wireless sensor networks WSNs. Thus, several void-handling techniques are proposed in the literature, but they are limited in case of critical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach handling both open and closed voids by using three complementary mechanisms. The first mechanism orients each packet that arrives on the network boundary toward the network middle by using the shortest path leading to the sink. The second mechanism is used by a node located on the boundary of a closed void to orient the received packets in optimal paths toward the sink. The third mechanism uses repellent forces generated by each closed void to repulse the packets from its boundary. To discharge the boundary nodes, our approach defines an announcement zone around each closed void and uses a two-hop forwarding mode in each boundary node.

Recently researchers have proposed low-cost reliability solutions that detect hardware faults through software-level symptom monitoring. SWAT (SoftWare Anomaly Treatment), one such solution, demonstrated with microarchitecture-level simulations that symptom-based solutions can provide high fault coverage and a low Silent Data Corruption (SDC) rate. However, more accurate evaluations are needed to validate such solutions for hardware faults in real-world processor designs. In this paper, we evaluate SWAT's symptom-based detectors on gate-level faults using an FPGA-based, full-system prototype. With this platform, we performed a gate-level accurate fault injection campaign of 51,630 fault injections in the OpenSPARC T1 core logic across five SPECInt 2000 benchmarks. With an overall SDC rate of 0.79%, our results are comparable to previous microarchitecture-level evaluations of SWAT, demonstrating the effectiveness of symptom-based software detectors for permanent faults in real-world designs.",[["53f45532dabfaee0d9bef514",null,null,"5b86b6c3e1cd8e14a34cb721","A.

This paper describes how core networks will evolve to optical transport networks (OTNs), which are optimized for the transport of data traffic, resulting in an IP-directly-over-OTN paradigm. Special attention is paid to the survivability of such data-centric optical networks. This becomes increasingly crucial since more and more traffic is multiplexed onto a single fiber (e.g., 160√ó10 Gb/s), implying that a single cable cut can affect incredible large traffic volumes. In particular, this paper is tackling multilayer survivability problems, since a data-centric optical network consists of at least an IP and optical layer. In practice, this means that the questions \"in which layer or layers should survivability be provided?\" and \"if multiple layers are chosen for this purpose, then how should this functionality in these layers be coordinated?\" have to be answered. In addition to a theoretical study, some case studies are presented in order to illustrate the relevance of the described issues and to help in strategic planning decisions. Two case studies are studying the problem from a capacity viewpoint.

For example, the accumulated relative service time per user per month can be calculated given individual transaction data from which the user compliance with a service agreement can be determined and possibly billing can be processed. Nevertheless, due to user privacy concerns, cryptographic research developed transactions based on unlinkable anonymous credentials. Given the nature of anonymous credentials the ease of managing accumulated data (e.g., per user) is lost. To restore the possibility of management and accumulation of data it seems that a suitable form of privacy preserving data mining is needed. Indeed, privacy preserving data mining methods have been suggested for various protocols and interactions where individual data can be contributed in an encrypted form, but not within the context of anonymous credentials. Given our motivation we suggest a new notion of performing \"privacy preserving data mining within the context of anonymous cryptographic credential systems,\" so as to protect both the privacy of individually contributed data and the identity of their sources while revealing only what is needed. To instantiate our approach we focus on a primitive we call \"data mining group signatures\" (DMGS), where it is possible for a set of authorities to employ distributed quorum control for conducting privacy preserving data mining operations on a batch of transactions while preserving maximum possible anonymity. We define and model the new primitive and its security goals, we then present a construction and finally show its privacy and security properties. Along the way we build a methodology that safely combines multi-server protocols as sub-procedures in a more general setting.",[["53f4508cdabfaee4dc7fa52d",null,"aggelos@cse.uconn.edu","5b86b665e1cd8e14a34a34ad","Aggelos Kiayias",null,null,null,null,"Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, USA",null,"5f71b2941c455f439fe3cd52",["Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA"],null,null],["5489320cdabfaed7b5fa3a05",null,null,"5b86cc1ce1cd8e14a3e6a42f","Shouhuai Xu",null,null,null,null,"University of Texas, San Antonio, USA",null,"5f71b2ca1c455f439fe3e48a",["Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA"],null,null],["53f582fbdabfaeaad3f8045b",null,null,"5b86bd39e1cd8e14a37b7ae0","Moti Yung",null,null,null,null,"Google Inc. and Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA",null,"5f71b2d21c455f439fe3e823",["Columbia Univ, Google Inc & Comp Sci, New York, NY USA"],null,null]],"10.1007/978-3-540-85855-3_5",["Data mining","Internet privacy","Privacy by Design","Cryptography","Computer security","Computer science","Encryption","Group signature","Anonymity","Information privacy","Transaction data","Credential"],"","0302-9743","",["anonymous credential systems","data mining","user privacy concern","data mining operation","data mining method","anonymous credential","privacy preserving data mining","individual transaction data","data mining group signature","individual data","anonymous cryptographic credential system","transaction data","group signature","it security"],"en",5,"76","57",null,["53e9af6eb7602d97039ae06a","53e99cdfb7602d9702591fb2","53e9a91ab7602d970326da29","599c7b32601a182cd2718313","53e9a8e3b7602d970323102b","53e99dbeb7602d970267cec4","53e9a23eb7602d9702b44be3","53e99924b7602d9702162950","53e9b641b7602d970419f7c9","53e99b36b7602d97023d6d1b","53e9b9b4b7602d97045a874e","53e9a67cb7602d9702fb11e6","53e99d13b7602d97025c4f08","53e9badfb7602d970470f3c8","53e99b36b7602d97023d6d1b","53e9be27b7602d9704ae124a","53e9a098b7602d970297f23b","599c7d32601a182cd280918d","53e9984fb7602d9702081de3","53e99818b7602d9702035f8f","53e9980eb7602d9702021d85","53e99b36b7602d97023d9353","53e9981db7602d9702039a3b","53e9b002b7602d9703a5bbb6","53e9b7c0b7602d970436b303","53e9a4b2b7602d9702dd201f","53e9aa7ab7602d97033f2e78","53e997fcb7602d97020095bd","53e9ab00b7602d9703482ba1","53e9a122b7602d9702a10813","53e99b36b7602d97023d6d1b","53e9af2db7602d970396aaa3"],"Privacy Preserving Data Mining within Anonymous Credential Systems",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-85855-3_5","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],["5550372b7cea80f954177a25",null,null,null,null,null,null,"SCN",null,null,null,null,0],"5229",2008],["5f71b2b11c455f439fe3d903","53e998c7b7602d9702100a60","It is well known that the Kraft inequality gives a necessary and sufficient condition on the codeword lengths of a zero-error instantaneous code for a single source.

This paper presents an improvement to the SIFT descriptor for image matching and retrieval. The framework of the proposed descriptor consists of the following steps: normalizing elliptical neighboring region, transforming to affine scale-space, improving the SIFT descriptor with polar histogram orientation bin, as well as integrating the mirror reflection invariant.

In this paper, an induced intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet (IFC) integral operator is proposed for the multiple criteria decision making. Some of its properties are investigated. Furthermore, an induced generalized IFC integral operator is introduced. It is worth mentioning that most of the existing intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators are special cases of this induced aggregation operator. A decision procedure based on the proposed induced aggregation operator is developed for solving the multicriteria decision-making problem in which all the decision information is represented by intuitionistic fuzzy values. An illustrative example is given for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed decision procedure. ¬© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ¬© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",[["53f43835dabfaec09f18dedc",null,null,"5b86b246e1cd8e14a32c2903","Chunqiao Tan",null,null,null,null,"School of Business, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China",null,"5f71b32e1c455f439fe410d4",[],null,null],[null,null,null,"5b86b246e1cd8e14a32c2903","Xiaohong Chen",null,null,null,null,"School of Business, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China",null,"5f71b32e1c455f439fe410d4",[],null,null]],"10.1002/int.20489",["Mathematical optimization","Multiple criteria","Fuzzy measure theory","Multicriteria decision","Intuitionistic fuzzy","Fuzzy set","Operator (computer programming)","Choquet integral","Mathematics"],"","","7",["order-induced aggregation","induced intuitionistic fuzzy choquet","existing intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation","proposed induced aggregation operator","wiley periodicals","multicriteria decision","integral operator","fuzzy choquet integral operator","choquet aggregation","decision information","induced aggregation operator","generalized ifc integral operator","choquet integral"],"en",46,"686","659",null,["573695916e3b12023e4b122e","53e9a1e7b7602d9702ae5deb","53e99e99b7602d9702760849","53e99a98b7602d970230de69","53e9aa81b7602d97033fbf8a","53e9bc0ab7602d970486fd0c","558b0338e4b031bae1fb041b","53e9b94db7602d9704537ab3","53e9ba84b7602d97046a6e15","53e9bc53b7602d97048cba15","53e9b8bab7602d970449612b","53e9a6d0b7602d9703005e0d","53e99809b7602d970201cb7e","53e9bd1eb7602d97049a6c9d","53e9b56cb7602d97040a66ea","557d4157f667eeed56199e4a","53e99d3db7602d97025f017e","53e9985fb7602d9702098255","53e9aab0b7602d970342f2bb","53e999bbb7602d97022041f0","53e99b7fb7602d9702427d07","53e999eeb7602d97022351ae","53e99a49b7602d97022aa985","53e997fcb7602d97020066f6","53e9a855b7602d97031a0368","53e9b861b7602d97044276d6","53e9b5ceb7602d9704117994","53e9b41bb7602d9703f14a1d","53e99fe4b7602d97028bf66f","53e9a98eb7602d97032e8fe6","53e997f8b7602d970200127d","53e9bb80b7602d97047c8017","53e99d12b7602d97025c432c","53e9b86db7602d9704437b77","5c77e9374895d9cbc663a13a","53e99aa6b7602d97023212e0","53e99d6cb7602d97026275bb","558a89b9e4b037c08757ba96","53e9a611b7602d9702f3e2e2","53e99809b7602d970201d1a1"],"Induced intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operator for multicriteria decision making",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/int.20489","https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1002/int.20489"],["555036e07cea80f95416278d",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Int.

By mapping out the bandstructure at the Œì-point, we have observed fine structure at the band edge. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted bandstructure. Above threshold, we observe a lasing peak at 965 nm at one of the band edges. The far-field distribution of the laser is measured, showing an annular profile and azimuthal polarization.

In particular, we focus on co-simulation, where an FMU either contains its own internal simulation algorithm or serves as a gateway to a simulation tool. We give conditions on the design of FMUs and master algorithms (which orchestrate the execution of FMUs) to achieve deterministic co-simulation. We show that with the current version of the standard, these conditions demand capabilities from FMUs that are optional in the standard and rarely provided by an FMU in practice. When FMUs lacking these required capabilities are used to compose a model, many basic modeling capabilities become unachievable, including simple discrete-event simulation and variable-step-size numerical integration algorithms. We propose a small extension to the standard and a policy for designing FMUs that enables deterministic execution for a much broader class of models. The extension enables a master algorithm to query an FMU for the time of events that are expected in the future. We show that a model can be executed deterministically if all FMUs in the model are either memoryless or implement one of rollback or step-size prediction. We show further that such a model can contain at most one \"legacy\" FMU that is not memoryless and provides neither rollback nor step-size prediction.",[["53f31966dabfae9a8442b54c",null,null,"5b86a889e1cd8e14a3eb23c3","David Broman",null,null,null,null,"University of California, Berkeley and Link√∂ping University, Sweden",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6b7",null,null,null],["53f43721dabfaee02acd065c",null,null,"5b86c411e1cd8e14a3ac7b62","Christopher Brooks",null,null,null,null,"University of California, Berkeley",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6b7",null,null,null],["53f43881dabfaedf43593539",null,null,"5b86c1b9e1cd8e14a39bce98","Lev Greenberg",null,null,null,null,"IBM",null,"5f71b5c41c455f439fe532ea",null,null,null],["53f642fcdabfaed5140f3cda",null,null,"5b86c411e1cd8e14a3ac7b62","Edward A.

In particular, each video file is analyzed in a multiscale structure of different \"content resolution levels\", creating a hierarchy from the lowest (coarse) to the highest (fine) resolution. The scheme resembles the progressive transmission of still images, where instead of transmitting the image sequentially at a full resolution, by scanning it line by line, a lower image resolution is first delivered and then, the image quality gradually enhances so that the user is able at any time to see a preview of the image content. The proposed video decomposition is represented as a graph structure, each level of which corresponds to a particular content resolution, while the graph-nodes the respective regions that the content is analyzed at this level. Transitions among nodes of the same level are also permitted. The number of nodes at a given level expresses the degree of detail that the content at this level is analyzed. This number is estimated by minimizing the average transmitted information, required for localizing a video segment of interest and also takes into account the content complexity.Quality criteria are introduced to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. The efficiency of the organization is maximized if multiscale content decomposition is performed using content representatives and constructing content classes. Content representatives are estimated in our approach as the ones of the maximum dissimilarity, expressed by a distance metric. The optimization is conducted by incorporating a stochastic algorithm of logarithmically reduced searching area (stochastic logarithmic). Experimental results on real-life video sequences show that the proposed multiscale video organization enables users to detect content of interest much faster, compared to the conventional sequential video scanning or other video decomposition/summarization methods, resulting in a better organization efficiency as measured by the quality criteria.",[["5489c2eadabfae8a11fb4771",null,"ndoulam@cs.ntua.gr",null,"Nikolaos Doulamis",null,null,null,null,"Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Computer Science Division, National Technical University of Athens, 11.23 office, 9, Heroon Polytechniou Street, Zografou 15773, Athens, Greece",null,"5f71b2d11c455f439fe3e77b",["Correspondent author.

In this paper we study the network lifetime maximization problem and the delay time minimization problem together. To make both problems tractable, we have the assumption that each sensor node keeps working since it turns on. And we formulate the network lifetime maximization problem as maximizing the number of sensor nodes who don't turn on, and the delay time minimization problem as minimizing the routing path length, after achieving the required tracking tasks. Since we prove the problems are NP-complete and APX-complete , we propose three heuristic algorithms to solve them.

An open evolvable onto-core is conceptually the combination of \"a closed skeletal TCM onto-core plus the master aliases table (MAT) contents\". The OCOE&CID mechanism automatically lets its text miner WEKA plough through the open web looking for new scientific findings. It then prunes the findings and adds the result to enrich the MAT contents.

The MAT contents are stored in four related special data structures, which can be appended/disconnected to/from the skeletal TCM onto-core. As a result, the knowledge updates in the open evolvable onto-core affect only the MAT contents and do not alter any of the original skeletal onto-core information that was installed by consensus certification.

While entropy schemes are highly robust to diverse network conditions, they remain vulnerable to distribute attacks that are similar to legitimate traffic. With the knowledge that the objective of a DDoS attack is to saturate as soon as possible the resources of the target, this would engender an unexpected disproportion between the number of received packets and the number of connections. However, in the case of flash crowds, an increase in the number of packets is always accompanied by an increase in the number of connections. In this work, we used joint-entropy that quantifies the degree of disproportion to detect traffic anomalies. We investigate a class of intelligent attacks, which, unlike high-rate attacks, are difficult for entropy schemes to detect. The experimental results indicate that our joint-entropy scheme can detect this type of attacks accurately. Compared with an entropy-based scheme, the improvement is 40% for the distributed attacks.

This is a difficult task for several reasons including the level of model detail, the technical aspects of experimental recordings and different experimental contexts. A recently developed method allows one to estimate synaptic background activities using subthreshold membrane potential distributions derived from intracellular recordings. This method requires the removal of spikes to obtain the estimates. We remove spikes from heterogeneous, inhibitory network model outputs (in which the underlying dynamics are understood) and obtain synaptic distributions from multiple simulations. We show that the distributions reflect the known model network characteristics and change appropriately with different parameter values.

The analysis of the data obtained from 193 IS users revealed a positive and significant association between perceived service quality and user satisfaction across the service zones and service dimensions with stronger associations in the acceptable service zone and weaker associations in the inadequate and superior service zones. Thus, the results demonstrate that the relationship between IS service quality and user satisfaction is affected by ZOT. It is found that the desired service expectation measure is more strongly related to service performance compared to the adequate service expectation measure. It is also observed that irrespective of the ZOT, the service dimension that contributes most to service performance is assurance.

The line balance and design costs objectives are simultaneously optimized by using an AND/OR Graph (AOG) of the product. The proposed GA is designed to generate Pareto-optimal solutions considering two different fitness evaluation approaches, repair algorithms and a diversification strategy. It is tested on 96 test problems that were generated using the benchmark problem generation scheme for problems defined on AOG as developed in literature. In addition, to validate the performance of the algorithm, a goal programming approach and a heuristic approach are presented and their results are compared with those obtained by using GA.

An algorithm was developed to construct a statistical shape model (SSM) for the adult postmortem liver in autopsy imaging.First, we investigated the relationship between SSMs obtained from in vivo liver CT scans and those from postmortem cases. Liver shapes were embedded in level set functions and statistically modeled using a spatially weighted principal components analysis. The performance of the SSMs was evaluated in terms of generalization and specificity. Several algorithms for the transformation from in vivo livers to postmortem livers were proposed to enhance the performance of an SSM for a postmortem liver, followed by a comparative study on SSMs. Specifically, five SSMs for a postmortem liver were constructed and evaluated using 32 postmortem liver labels, and postmortem liver labels synthesized from 144 in vivo liver labels were constructed using the proposed transformation algorithms. We also compared the proposed SSMs with three conventional SSMs trained from postmortem liver labels and/or in vivo liver labels.The investigation showed that the performance of an SSM constructed using in vivo liver labels suffered when describing postmortem liver shapes. Two of the five proposed SSMs trained using synthesized postmortem livers showed the best performance with no significant differences between them, and they statistically outperformed all conventional SSMs tested.The performance of conventional SSMs can be improved by using both postmortem liver shape labels and artificial shape labels synthesized from in vivo liver shape labels.",[["543289e5dabfaeb54215b01a",null,"50013834203@st.tuat.ac.jp",null,"Atsushi Saito",null,null,null,null,"Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,Koganei,Japan",null,"5f71b4041c455f439fe47001",null,null,null],["56021c1445cedb3395f0eca6",null,null,null,"Akinobu Shimizu",null,null,null,null,"Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,Koganei,Japan",null,"5f71b4041c455f439fe47001",null,null,null],["53f42b46dabfaedd74d159a9",null,null,null,"Hidefumi Watanabe",null,null,null,null,"Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,Koganei,Japan",null,"5f71b4041c455f439fe47001",null,null,null],["53f42bd9dabfaedf434ff0d1",null,null,null,"Seiji Yamamoto",null,null,null,null,"Ai Information Center,Chuo-ku,Japan",null,null,null,null,null],["5487802edabfaed7b5fa30b3",null,null,null,"Shigeru Nawano",null,null,null,null,"Department of Radiology,International University of Health and Welfare, Mita Hospital,Minato-ku,Japan",null,"5f71b44d1c455f439fe49077",null,null,null],["5448dbacdabfae87b7e882a8",null,null,null,"Hidefumi Kobatake",null,null,null,null,"Institute of National Colleges of Technology,Hachioji,Japan",null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1007/s11548-013-0923-6",["Autopsy","Liver ct","Radiology","Medicine"],"","1861-6429","2",["Statistical shape model"," Liver"," Autopsy imaging"," Synthesized-based learning"," Level set"," PCA"],"en",0,"281","269",null,["53e9b91eb7602d97045079f0","53e99ca8b7602d9702559b7b","56d8e56adabfae2eee2e14fb","53e9b077b7602d9703ade057","53e9bb4bb7602d970478c2d1","53e9b911b7602d97044f9002","53e9bbdbb7602d9704829095","5c7853a74895d9cbc691afc6","53e9bcc1b7602d9704943398","53e9987db7602d97020b5f51","53e99d36b7602d97025e9093","53e9b693b7602d9704205730","53e9a3e7b7602d9702d00820","53e9bd0ab7602d9704990902","53e99e54b7602d970271b0aa","55a5a99d612c6b12ab297194","53e9bb52b7602d97047922d3","53e9ad26b7602d9703706a5a","573696176e3b12023e529eeb"],"Statistical shape model of a liver for autopsy imaging.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11548-013-0923-6","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877279?report=xml&format=text","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11548-013-0923-6"],["555036c67cea80f954154646",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Int.

The relative performance of these methods in the different geographical regions, which vary in sample size, is of primary interest.

Messages were coded based on content, form and specific features as well as on the manifest relationship to existing genres of communication. The paper argues that spam is not a single genre but many genres. For the most part, the genres evoked in spam are adaptations of print to Internet, including information artifacts, pamphlets, business cards, order forms, bulletins, advertisements, and \"Nigerian letters\". With spam, however, the concept of genre operates at several levels. Often, there is a contradiction between the manifest genre and the underlying purposes.

In particular, bargaining solutions in the game theory are applied to allocate the limited resources to users for the purpose of proportional fairness. We assume that users can choose one of discriminated media services and multimedia resources are then allocated to users according to their service selections.

It corresponds to comparing, via fuzzy set inclusion, possibility distributions that are the most specific transforms of the original probability distributions. This partial ordering compares discrete probability distributions in terms of relative peakedness around their mode, and entropy is monotonic with respect to this partial ordering. In fact, all known variants of entropy share this monotonicity. In this paper, this question is studied in the case of unimodal continuous probability densities on the real line, for which a possibility transform around the mode exists. It corresponds to extracting the family of most precise prediction intervals. Comparing such prediction intervals for two densities yields a variant of relative peakedness in the sense of Birnbaum. We show that a generalized form of continuous entropy is monotonic with respect to this form of relative peakedness of densities.",[["53f39e0ddabfae4b34aa7791",null,null,"5b86b6c8e1cd8e14a34cd6f8","In√©s Couso",null,null,null,null,"University of Oviedo, Spain",null,"5f71b2cb1c455f439fe3e4f8",null,null,null],["53f556badabfaea7cd1d5eaf",null,null,"5b869d67e1cd8e14a3a26b16","Didier Dubois",null,null,null,null,"IRIT, CNRS, Toulouse",null,"5f71b28c1c455f439fe3c9b4",null,null,null]],"10.1007/978-3-642-14049-5_22",["Statistical physics","Combinatorics","K-distribution","Mode (statistics)","Probability measure","Probability distribution","Differential entropy","Principle of maximum entropy","Entropy (information theory)","Mathematics","Maximum entropy probability distribution"],"3-642-14048-3","","",["discrete probability distribution","precise prediction interval","generalized entropy","unimodal continuous probability density","continuous density function","densities yield","continuous entropy","relative peakedness","generalized form","entropy share","original probability distribution","possibility distribution","probability density","partial order","fuzzy set","prediction interval","probability distribution"],"en",1,"219","208",null,["53e9a80cb7602d970314e85a","53e9ab4fb7602d97034e2c99","53e9b27bb7602d9703d1f0a5","53e9a885b7602d97031d270f","53e9abebb7602d97035a9a3a","56d8f6c6dabfae2eee9874a0"],"Peakedness and generalized entropy for continuous density functions",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-14049-5_22"],["53a72c6620f7420be8c44ffe",null,null,"Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty",null,null,null,"IPMU",null,null,null,null,0],"",2010],["5f71b38a1c455f439fe43962","53e99905b7602d9702145e2f","These working notes focus on the users' actions in order to assist translations and on the usage of personal dictionaries (a feature which enables saving user added words).

However, this method is not a suitable one for large datasets because of its quadratic time complexity with respect to the size of the dataset. This paper presents a simple prototype based hybrid approach to speed-up the kernel k-means clustering method for large datasets. The proposed method works in two stages. First, the dataset is partitioned into a number of small grouplets by using the leaders clustering method which takes the size of each grouplet, called the threshold t, as an input parameter. The conventional leaders clustering method is modified such that these grouplets are formed in the kernel induced feature space, but each grouplet is represented by a pattern (called its leader) in the input space. The dataset is re-indexed according to these grouplets. Later, the kernel k-means clustering method is applied over the set of leaders to derive a partition of the leaders set. Finally, each leader is replaced by its group to get a partition of the entire dataset. The time complexity as well as space complexity of the proposed method is O(n+p^2), where p is the number of leaders. The overall running time and the quality of the clustering result depends on the threshold t and the order in which the dataset is scanned. This paper presents a study on how the input parameter t affects the overall running time and the clustering quality obtained by the proposed method. Further, both theoretically and experimentally it has been shown how the order of scanning of the dataset affects the clustering result. The proposed method is also compared with the other recent methods that are proposed to speed-up the kernel k-means clustering method. Experimental study with several real world as well as synthetic datasets shows that, for an appropriate value of t, the proposed method can significantly reduce the computation time but with a small loss in clustering quality, particularly for large datasets.",[["53f31b4adabfae9a8443613b",null,"t.hitendrasarma@gmail.com","5b86a981e1cd8e14a3f17084","T.

In this paper, we extend the BA problem over a combined wired/wireless network, consisting of both powerful computing stationary processor and low-power mobile processor.

In order to achieve load balancing for users' timeliness access and guarantee that users can always get the information from a certain pathway, autonomous information reallocation technology is proposed.",[["53f4d246dabfaeedd777fd0d",null,null,"5b86b6d4e1cd8e14a34d2fca","Xiaodong Lu",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computer Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan",null,"5f71b2a41c455f439fe3d46e",null,null,null],["53f7b486dabfae7f97a24c69",null,null,"5b86b6d4e1cd8e14a34d2fca","Yi Zhou",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computer Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan",null,"5f71b2a41c455f439fe3d46e",null,null,null],["53f42aa2dabfaec22b9e9cd6",null,null,"5b86b6d4e1cd8e14a34d2fca","Misato Tasaka",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computer Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan",null,"5f71b2a41c455f439fe3d46e",null,null,null],["53f42db0dabfaee2a1c8071f",null,null,"5b86b6d4e1cd8e14a34d2fca","Ivan Luque",null,null,null,"0000-0003-1838-2636","Department of Computer Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan",null,"5f71b2a41c455f439fe3d46e",null,null,null],["54489419dabfae87b7e47e93",null,null,"5b86b6d4e1cd8e14a34d2fca","Kinji Mori",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computer Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan",null,"5f71b2a41c455f439fe3d46e",null,null,null],["53f463c1dabfaee2a1da451a",null,null,"5b86aad2e1cd8e14a3f9ef3b","Ryuji Takanuki",null,null,null,null,"Hitachi, Ltd., Totsukaku, Yokohama, Japan",null,"5f71b2901c455f439fe3cb72",null,null,null]],"10.1109/HASE.2004.1281756",["Information system","Load management","Computer security","Load balancing (computing)","Computer science","Service system","Quality of service","Fault tolerance","Resource allocation","Information provision"],"0-7695-2094-4","","",["load balancing","demand-oriented information service system","certain pathway","agent allocation","high-assurance information service system","demand change","autonomous rating","autonomous information provision technology","autonomous information reallocation technology","important infrastructure","information system","heterogeneous requirement","high response","reliable information service provision","computer science","mobile agent","explosives","resource allocation","fault tolerance","information services","quality of service","load balance","electronic commerce","distributed programming"],"en",0,"276","275","//static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/239/194/autonomous_rating_oriented_agent_allocation_to_achieve_high_response_in.pdf",null,"Autonomous rating oriented agent allocation to achieve high response in demand-oriented information service system",["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/HASE.2004.1281756","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HASE.2004.1281756","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],["555037047cea80f95416df95",null,null,null,null,null,null,"HASE",null,null,null,null,0],"",2004],["5f71b2af1c455f439fe3d85d","53e99915b7602d970214ec62","This paper describes the results of the European Project AMIRA (Advanced Multimodal Intelligence for Remote Assistance) which deals with the support of emergency services (in particular fire services) by Ambient Intelligence.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of grouping the sensor nodes into clusters to enhance the overall scalability of the network. A selected set of nodes, known as gateway nodes, will act as cluster-heads for each cluster and the objective is to balance the load among these gateways. Load-Balanced Clustering increases system stability and improves the communication between the various nodes in the network. We call the problem addressed in this paper as the Load-Balanced Clustering Problem (LBCP). We first show that a special case of LBCP (whereby the traffic load contributed by all sensor nodes are the same) is optimally solvable in polynomial time. We next prove that the general case of LBCP is NP-hard.

Under these conditions and in the presence of noise, the voxel intensity histogram is monomodal; therefore, segmenting the image with an intensity threshold is inaccurate. The present method, which is applicable to two-phase materials of discrete intensity, relies on iterative deconvolution to obtain a noiseless histogram. A noiseless image is then generated on the basis of the noiseless histogram and the unprocessed image. In the current work, the method is referred to as bone volume fraction (BVF) mapping, since it has been applied to determine the spatial distribution of trabecular bone. BVF computed from maps generated on the basis of in vivo magnetic resonance images of the human radius has been shown to compare well with bone mineral density (R 2 5 0.8). The accuracy and precision of BVF measurements have been further evaluated by using a BVF map of the radius as a gold standard and then adding different levels of noise to generate test images. The results suggest that the error in BVF is ,0.01 for SNR . 8. ¬© 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Int J Imaging Syst Technol, 10, 186 -198, 1999",[["53f47e6edabfaee4dc8a97af",null,null,null,"Scott N.

However the bulk of modems today have remained a combination of digital signal processors and ASICs. The demise of the DSP has been predicted many times over the last decade and yet it remains a strong part of cellular infrastructure. So what changes are really happening?

Interestingly, detection can take much longer than recovery, as a result of many advances in recovery techniques, making failure detection the dominant factor in these systems' unavailability when a crash occurs. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Falcon, a failure detector with several features. First, Falcon's common-case detection time is sub-second, which keeps unavailability low. Second, Falcon is reliable: it never reports a process as down when it is actually up. Third, Falcon sometimes kills to achieve reliable detection but aims to kill the smallest needed component. Falcon achieves these features by coordinating a network of spies, each monitoring a layer of the system. Falcon's main cost is a small amount of platform-specific logic. Falcon is thus the first failure detector that is fast, reliable, and viable. As such, it could change the way that a class of distributed systems is built.",[["53f4351cdabfaec09f171e21",null,null,"5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598","Joshua B.

These examples constitute one\n of the main challenges to the received view on the foundations of decision theory offered by Leonard Savage in Savage (1972).\n Craig Fox and Amos Tversky have, nevertheless, offered an indirect defense of Savage. They provided in Fox and Tversky (1995)\n an explanation of Ellsberg‚Äôs two-color problem in terms of a psychological effect: ambiguity aversion.

We present first an experiment that extends Ellsberg‚Äôs two-color problem where certain predictions\n of the comparative ignorance hypothesis are not confirmed. In addition the hypothesis seems unable to explain how the subjects\n resolve trade-offs between security and expected pay-off when vagueness is present. Ellsberg offered an explanation of the\n typical behavior elicited by his examples in terms of these trade-offs and in section three we offer a model of Ellsberg‚Äôs\n trade-offs.

Most of previous works have been focused only on visual information (i.e., image signal), thus missing an important source of information present in human interactions: the audio. So far, such approaches have not shown to be discriminative enough. This work proposes the use of Audio-Visual Bag of Words (AVBOW) as a more powerful mechanism to approach the HIR problem than the traditional Visual Bag of Words (VBOW). We show in this paper that the combined use of video and audio information yields to better classification results than video alone. Our approach has been validated in the challenging TVHID dataset showing that the proposed AVBOW provides statistically significant improvements over the VBOW employed in the related literature.",[["53f44246dabfaee2a1d2680a",null,"mjmarin@uco.es","5b869dcae1cd8e14a3a501bf","M.

In practice, non-Euclidean or non-metric dissimilarity measures may arise when contours, spectra or shapes are compared by edit distances or as a consequence of robust object matching [1,2]. It is an open issue whether such measures are advantageous for statistical learning or whether they should be constrained to obey the metric axioms. The k-nearest neighbor (NN) rule is widely applied to general dissimilarity data as the most natural approach. Alternative methods exist that embed such data into suitable representation spaces in which statistical classifiers are constructed [3]. In this paper, we investigate the relation between non-Euclidean aspects of dissimilarity data and the classification performance of the direct NN rule and some classifiers trained in representation spaces. This is evaluated on a parameterized family of edit distances, in which parameter values control the strength of non-Euclidean behavior. Our finding is that the discriminative power of this measure increases with increasing non-Euclidean and non-metric aspects until a certain optimum is reached. The conclusion is that statistical classifiers perform well and the optimal values of the parameters characterize a non-Euclidean and somewhat non-metric measure.",[["53f44a0fdabfaee02ad27d3d",null,"e.m.pekalska@tudelft.nl","5b86a70ae1cd8e14a3e14517","El≈ºbieta Pƒôkalska",null,null,null,null,"Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands",null,"5f71b28a1c455f439fe3c93b",null,null,null],["53f435cadabfaeb2ac04e5f6",null,null,"5b86a70ae1cd8e14a3e14517","Artsiom Harol",null,null,null,null,"Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands",null,"5f71b28a1c455f439fe3c93b",null,null,null],["53f4e081dabfaefae477b3ba",null,null,"5b86a70ae1cd8e14a3e14517","Robert P.

A linear stability analysis and a numerical simulation of the governing equations are performed in order to determine and characterize the instability of the flow.

This paper contributes to the solution of these problems by presenting: linear regression models for power consumption and a detailed study of energy efficiency in a modern out-of-order superscalar microprocessor. These simple (2-input) yet accurate (2.6% error) models provide a valuable tool for identifying opportunities to apply power saving techniques such as clock throttling and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). Also, future work in improving energy efficiency is motivated by a detailed analysis of SPEC CPU 2000 workloads.

CTDL is a randomized learning technique which interweaves two search processes that operate in the intra-game and inter-game mode. Intra-game learning is driven by gradient-descent Temporal Difference Learning (TDL), a reinforcement learning method that updates the board evaluation function according to differences observed between its values for consecutively visited game states. For the inter-game learning component, we provide a coevolutionary algorithm that maintains a sample of strategies and uses the outcomes of games played between them to iteratively modify the probability distribution, according to which new strategies are generated and added to the sample. We analyze CTDL's sensitivity to all important parameters, including the trace decay constant that controls the lookahead horizon of TDL, and the relative intensity of intra-game and inter-game learning. We also investigate how the presence of memory (an archive) affects the search performance, and find out that the archived approach is superior to other techniques considered here and produces strategies that outperform a handcrafted weighted piece counter strategy and simple liberty-based heuristics. This encouraging result can be potentially generalized not only to other strategy representations used for small-board Go, but also to various games and a broader class of problems, because CTDL is generic and does not rely on any problem-specific knowledge.",[["54334d31dabfaeb542184ece",null,null,"5b86cd8de1cd8e14a3f14b81","Krzysztof Krawiec",null,null,null,null,"Institute of Computing Science, Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology, ul.

In the Bayes linear (BL) methodology prior judgements about uncertain quantities are specified using expectation (rather than probability) as the fundamental notion. BL provides a strong foundation for moment methods, rooted in work of De Finetti and Goldstein. The main objective of this paper is to discuss in what way expert assessments of moments can be combined, in a non-Bayesian way, to construct a prior assessment. We show that the linear pool can be justified in an analogous but technically different way to linear pools for probability assessments, and that this linear pool has a very convenient property: a linear pool of experts‚Äô assessments of moments is coherent if each of the experts has given coherent assessments. To determine the weights of the linear pool we give a method of performance based weighting analogous to Cooke's classical model and explore its properties.

These systems serve as models for positive systems. A necessary and sufficient condition for global asymptotic stability of the zero solution of this class of systems is known. Adding a constant control allows to shift the equilibrium point from zero to a point in the first orthant. We prove that for every nontrivial nonnegative control vector a unique nontrivial equilibrium point is achieved which is globally asymptotically stable if the zero solution of the uncontrolled system is globally asymptotically stable. In addition a converse result is provided. Finally a stability result for a particular class of Kolmogorov systems is established.

In this research, we focused on the switching problem of FES, which is one of the obstacles that prevent FES from further practical uses. An adaptive switching for FES control for the lower limbs‚Äô activities of hemiplegic patients was developed, based on the consideration that, lower limbs‚Äô activities need the synchronization of limbs of both sides. Electromyogram (EMG) signals detected from normal side of hemiplegic patients were used to recognize the activities that the patients intend to do. The recognition results were utilized as the switching signals. However, motion patterns represented and analyzed by EMG are distinctive of individual variations and characteristic alternation, which inevitably result in classification errors in EMG analyzing. To overcome these problems, a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) was embedded in an on-line process to form an analyzing system that can adapt to individual characteristics and trace the nonstationary factor. Furthermore, in order to enable the analyzing system to recognize right timings from the EMG-described dynamical processes of activities, such as standing-up and walking, a practical training-set construction method that utilizes additional reference data was proposed. The proposed switching system was applied to a FES system that supports standing-up and walking for a hemiplegics subject, to verify the effectiveness.",[["5602315e45cedb3395f3177c",null,"yu@complex.eng.hokudai.ac.jp",null,"Wenwei Yu",null,null,null,null,"Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan",null,null,["Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan","Corresponding author."],null,null],["5602315e45cedb3395f3177f",null,null,"5b86b150e1cd8e14a3253f43","Hiroshi Yamaguchi",null,null,null,null,"Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan",null,"5f71b29d1c455f439fe3d17c",["Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan"],null,null],["563046b445cedb33999c15fa",null,null,"5b86b150e1cd8e14a3253f43","Hiroshi Yokoi",null,null,null,null,"Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan",null,"5f71b29d1c455f439fe3d17c",["Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan"],null,null],["53f4374adabfaee2a1cee583",null,null,null,"Masaharu Maruishi",null,null,null,null,"Department of Rehabilitation, Hiroshima Rehabilitation Center, Hiroshima, Japan",null,null,["Department of Rehabilitation, Hiroshima Rehabilitation Center, Hiroshima, Japan"],null,null],["53f43aa3dabfaee02acf3684",null,null,"5b86b150e1cd8e14a3253f43","Yukio Mano",null,null,null,null,"Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan",null,"5f71b29d1c455f439fe3d17c",["Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan"],null,null],["54480bd5dabfae87b7dcac07",null,null,"5b86b150e1cd8e14a3253f43","Yukinori Kakazu",null,null,null,null,"Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan",null,"5f71b29d1c455f439fe3d17c",["Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan"],null,null]],"10.1016/S0921-8890(02)00246-4",["Reference data (financial markets)","Functional electrical stimulation","Adaptive switching","Synchronization","Simulation","Computer science","Control engineering","Artificial neural network","Construction method","Normal side","Alternation (linguistics)"],"","0921-8890","2",["Functional Electrical Stimulation","EMG","Artificial neural network","Machine learning","Human‚Äìmachine interface"],"en",32,"224","213",null,null,"EMG automatic switch for FES control for hemiplegics using artificial neural network",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8890(02)00246-4","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889002002464","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],[null,"0921-8890",null,null,null,null,"North-Holland","Robotics and Autonomous Systems",null,"robotics-and-autonomous-systems",null,"J",null],"40",2002],["5f71b2961c455f439fe3ce4d","53e99938b7602d97021790f9","In this paper, we present an efficient query-by-singing based musical retrieval system.

Experiments show that the 3rd coefficient is the most relevant to music comparison out of 13 coefficients and the proposed simplified MFCC feature is able to achieve a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To improve system efficiency, we re-organize the database by a new two-stage clustering scheme in both time space and feature space.

Also in these environments, we believe that price needs to be adapted to reflect and influence dynamic change in demand on resources, and can be used, as an economic mechanism, to efficiently manage a utility computing environment. To achieve this, we propose in this paper an adaptive pricing mechanism. The objective of this scheme is twofold: it, for business objectives, adapts price based upon the supply and demand curves over time intervals; on the other hand, price invisibly manages the distribution of resource demand across time intervals, therefore makes resource utilization more efficient and balanced over time. In this approach, the resource unit to be priced is called capacity unit, and applications are billed based upon the capacity units that have been reserved or used.",[["53f436a5dabfaeb1a7bf5fd7",null,null,null,"Jinsong Ouyang",null,null,null,null,"California State University-Sacramento******",null,"5f71b2b61c455f439fe3db7a",["California State University-Sacramento******"],null,null],["54861253dabfae8a11fb2f79",null,null,null,"Akhil Sahai",null,null,null,null,"Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Rd., Palo Alto, CA, USA, Akhil.Sahai@hp.com",null,"5f71b47f1c455f439fe4a655",["Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Rd., Palo Alto, CA, USA, Akhil.Sahai@hp.com"],null,null],["53f42d15dabfaedf435126b9",null,null,null,"Jim Pruyne",null,null,null,null,"Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Rd., Palo Alto, CA, USA, Jim.Pruyne@hp.com",null,"5f71b47f1c455f439fe4a655",["Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Rd., Palo Alto, CA, USA, Jim.Pruyne@hp.com"],null,null]],"10.1109/BDIM.2007.375010",["Resource management","Microeconomics","Operations research","Utility computing","Resource allocation","Memory management","Shared resource","Supply and demand","Resource utilization","Multiple time dimensions","Business"],"1-4244-1295-1","","",["multiple users","on-demand services","utility computing environment","resource utilization","shared resource pool","adaptive pricing mechanism","resource metering","resource allocation","resource reservation","demand and supply","capacity unit","utility services providers","adaptive pricing","utility computing","pricing","environmental management","resource management","environmental economics","computational modeling","computer vision","service provider","supply and demand","computer science","memory management"],"en",3,"44","39",null,["53e9b54ab7602d97040838c8","53e9b4e9b7602d9704012445","53e9b7b4b7602d970435c58f","53e99976b7602d97021b9b08","53e9a7b3b7602d97030eeff3","53e9b96fb7602d970456049c","53e9ab2bb7602d97034b5a47","557ce43c6feeaa8086da33c9","53e9b500b7602d970402e506"],"A Mechanism of Specifying and Determining Pricing in Utility Computing Environments",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BDIM.2007.375010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261099","http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/bdim/bdim2007.html#OuyangSP07","http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000004261099","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4261099"],["53a72d5920f7420be8c62951",null,null,null,null,null,null,"BDIM",null,null,null,null,0],"",2007],["5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31","53e9993fb7602d970217b1bb","Lines restoration is a specific research issue needed attentions in the image restoration and representation field.

We add to these a less well-known method called interval feature extraction. It overproduces features from the ERP signal and then eliminates irrelevant and redundant features by the fast correlation-based filter. To make the comparisons fair, the other feature-extraction methods were also run with the filter. An experiment on two EEG datasets (four classification scenarios) was carried out to examine the classification accuracy of four classifiers on the extracted features: support vector machines with linear and perceptron kernel, the nearest neighbour classifier and the random forest ensemble method.

Therefore, we propose an architecture to discover the key users in a virtual community. By applying the architecture, it would be a very efficient and low cost approach.

The intent is to heuristically identify \"interesting\" rules more efficiently, from less data. This challenge is similar to that of identifying \"high-value\" attributes within the more general framework of machine learning, where early identification of key attributes can profoundly influence the learning outcome. In developing heuristics for improving the focus of association rule mining, there is also the question of where in the overall process such heuristics are applied. For example, many such focusing methods have been applied after the generation of a large number of rules, providing a kind of ranking or filtering. An alternative is to constrain the input data earlier in the data mining process, in an attempt to deploy heuristics in advance, and hope that early resource savings provide similar or even better mining results.

To relax this assumption, which is often violated in practice, we derive a robust wavelet thresholding technique based on the minimax description length (MMDL) principle. We first determine the least favorable distribution in the Œµ-contaminated normal family as the member that maximizes the entropy. We show that this distribution, and the best estimate based upon it, namely the maximum-likelihood estimate, together constitute a saddle point. The MMDL approach results in a thresholding scheme that is resistant to heavy tailed noise. We further extend this framework and propose a novel approach to selecting an adapted or best basis (BB) that results in optimal signal reconstruction. Finally, we address the practical case where the underlying signal is known to be bounded, and derive a two-sided thresholding technique that is resistant to outliers and has bounded error",[["53f44f52dabfaee0d9bd7725",null,null,"5b86ad29e1cd8e14a308fca7","H.

Here, deception refers to a preemptive and intelligent use of concealed interdiction assets and decoys by the defender, in addition to transparent assets commonly employed in modeling defender-attacker problems. These models can help security planners to locate a limited number of checkpoints and sensors of various types to, for example, detect the smuggling of illegal products. The problem is complex, in part, because the objective functions of the defender and the attacker are different, and because the latter (which represents the attacker's behavior) is difficult to predict by the defender. First, we use duality theory and a generalized network flow model to devise an equivalent mixed-integer programming formulation, and develop its Benders decomposition. We extend this formulation with a multiobjective approach to account for several behaviors simultaneously. The computational effort to solve these models is considerable, as exemplified by our testing on a variety of cases for a medium-sized, notional network. Published 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This hierarchical structure is a result of cognitive evolution. Therefore, the ordering of the individual modules will follow the general rules of phylogeny. In particular, the complexity of spatial tasks to be solved by an organism and the behaviours evolved as adaptation to these tasks is of great relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to spatial hierarchy based on the complexity of the tasks, rather than on the complexity of the underlying mechanisms. Individual levels of the task hierachy are discussed from a theoretical point of view and specific experimental examples are given.

The original parallel MPI version of the QMC code was,developed,by the Electronic Structure of Solids HPCI consortium,in collaboration with EPCC. This code has been highly successful, and has resulted in numerous publications based on results generated,on the National Cray MPP systems,at EPCC. Recent interest has focussed,on also utilising shared-memory,parallelism in the code since future HPC systems,are expected,to comprise,clusters of SMP nodes. The code,has been,re-written to allow for an arbitrary mix,of OpenMP and MPI parallelism. The various,issues which,arose during,the parallelisation are discussed. The performance,of the mixed,OpenMP/MPI code has been assessed on an SGI Origin 2000 system,and,the results compared,and,contrasted to the original MPI version.

The function to be computed is f G (x 1 ,...,x n ) : = x 1 ¬∑...¬∑x n where each participant P i holds an input x i from the non-commutative group G . The settings of their study are the passive adversary model, information-theoretic security and black-box group operations over G . They presented three results. The first one is that honest majority is needed to ensure security when computing f G . Second, when the number of adversary $t\\leq\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil-1$, they reduced building such a secure protocol to a graph coloring problem and they showed that there exists a deterministic secure protocol computing f G using exponential communication complexity. Finally, Desmedt et al. turned to analyze random coloring of a graph to show the existence of a probabilistic protocol with polynomial complexity when t n /Œº , in which Œº is a constant less than 2.948. We call their analysis method of random coloring the counting method as it is based on the counting of the number of a specific type of random walks. This method is inspiring because, as far as we know, it is the first instance in which the theory of self-avoiding walk appears in multiparty computation. In this paper, we first give an altered exposition of their proof.

Interaction formalisation is considered as a key point to synchronise heterogeneous models and to provide more interoperability between various computer assisted systems.

However, traditional garbage collection is approaching both practical and theoretical performance limits. In practice, the maximum heap size and heap structure of large applications are influenced as much by garbage collector behavior as by resource availability.\n\nWe present an alternate approach to garbage collection wherein the programmer provides untrusted deallocation hints. Usage of deallocation hints is similar to trusted manual deallocation, but the consequence of an inaccurate hint is lost performance not correctness. Our hinted collector algorithm uses these hints to identify a subset of unreachable objects with both better parallel asymptotic complexity and practical performance. On some benchmarks, our prototype collector implementation achieves 10-20% pause time reductions. We close with a discussion of the design trade-offs inherent in our approach and lessons to be learned from our collector.\n\n",[["53f439d7dabfaee02acea34d",null,null,"5b86b6cce1cd8e14a34cf6f7","Philip Reames",null,null,null,null,"University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6b7",null,null,null],["53f4323edabfaedf4355416f",null,null,"5b86b6cce1cd8e14a34cf6f7","George Necula",null,null,null,null,"University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6b7",null,null,null]],"10.1145/2464157.2464158",["Garbage","Programming language","Programmer","Computer science","Manual memory management","Correctness","Heap (data structure)","Memory management","Garbage collection","Garbage in, garbage out"],"978-1-4503-2100-6","","",["collector algorithm","theoretical performance limit","garbage collector behavior","garbage collector pause time","garbage collection","manual deallocation","practical performance","deallocation hint","traditional garbage collection","prototype collector implementation","alternate approach","memory management"],"en",4,"14","3",null,["53e99ae7b7602d97023706f1","53e99867b7602d97020a225b","53e9aed7b7602d97038ff826","53e9b724b7602d97042b909f","53e9b667b7602d97041ccf2f","53e99f48b7602d97028177a8","53e9b55db7602d97040949cd","53e99afdb7602d9702389cf1","53e9ba45b7602d9704659f1a","53e9abc4b7602d9703575d15","53e9ab48b7602d97034db606","53e9b338b7602d9703e0d187","53e9b388b7602d9703e6a129","53e9b1b0b7602d9703c4052a","53e9b8a1b7602d970447b465","53e9adc2b7602d97037c92a2","53e9aa32b7602d970339e11b","53e9a869b7602d97031b440f","53e99c36b7602d97024e28d1","56d921f9dabfae2eeea35127","53e9a70bb7602d9703040f32","53e99ca8b7602d970255bc19","53e99a14b7602d97022671da","53e99a2bb7602d9702284a7b"],"Towards hinted collection: annotations for decreasing garbage collector pause times",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2464157.2464158","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2464157.2464158","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2491894.2464158&COLL=DL&DL=acm&preflayout=flat","https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2491894.2464158"],["555037227cea80f954175427",null,null,null,null,null,null,"ISMM",null,null,null,null,0],"",2013],["5f71b2811c455f439fe3c592","53e99959b7602d970219a631","We propose an efficient modeling method for electrokinetic flows based on the Smoothed Profile Method (SPM) [1-4] and spectral element discretizations.

Specifically, its computational complexity amounts to maximally 55% of that of the overall syntax parsing process. In this paper, we aim at an efficient hardware design of the motion data decoding process for H.264/AVC, for which all the key design considerations are addressed in detail and respective rational answers are presented.

Its value depends on the proportion pi(0) of non-differentially expressed (non-DE) genes. In most microarray studies, many genes have small effects not easily separable from non-DE genes. As a result, current methods often overestimate pi(0) and FDR, leading to unnecessary loss of power in the overall analysis.For the common two-sample comparison we derive a natural mixture model of the test statistic and an explicit bias formula in the standard estimation of pi(0). We suggest an improved estimation of pi(0) based on the mixture model and describe a practical likelihood-based procedure for this purpose.The analysis shows that a large bias occurs when pi(0) is far from 1 and when the non-centrality parameters of the distribution of the test statistic are near zero. The theoretical result also explains substantial discrepancies between non-parametric and model-based estimates of pi(0). Simulation studies indicate mixture-model estimates are less biased than standard estimates. The method is applied to breast cancer and lymphoma data examples.An R-package OCplus containing functions to compute pi(0) based on the mixture model, the resulting FDR and other operating characteristics of microarray data, is freely available at http://www.meb.ki.se/~yudpawyudi.pawitan@meb.ki.se and alexander.ploner@meb.ki.se.",[["53f45372dabfaee02ad4d9c6",null,"yudi.pawitan@meb.ki.se",null,"Yudi Pawitan",null,null,null,null,"Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet  17177 Stockholm, Sweden",null,"5f71b2921c455f439fe3cc7d",[],null,null],["53f4611cdabfaee4dc838a9c",null,null,"5b8690a9e1cd8e14a34d7eeb","Karuturi R Krishna Murthy",null,null,null,null,"Genome Institute of Singapore  Singapore",null,null,[],null,null],["53f434bedabfaedd74d91580",null,null,"5b868b2ee1cd8e14a32a97ca","Stefan Michiels",null,null,null,"0000-0002-6963-2968","Unit of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Institute Gustave Roussy  Villejuif, France",null,"5f71b5211c455f439fe4eff7",[],null,null],["53f4627ddabfaedf4363675d",null,null,null,"Alexander Ploner",null,null,null,"0000-0002-5042-8326","Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet  17177 Stockholm, Sweden",null,"5f71b2921c455f439fe3cc7d",[],null,null]],"10.1093/bioinformatics/bti626",["Data mining","False discovery rate","Microarray","Test statistic","Microarray analysis techniques","Statistics","Mathematics","Mixture model"],"","1367-4803","20",["false discovery rate","microarray study","improved estimation","microarray data","non-de gene","large bias","test statistic","explicit bias formula","natural mixture model","lymphoma data example","mixture model","breast cancer"],"en",80,"3872","3865",null,["53e9ac13b7602d97035d77c6","53e9a6edb7602d9703022e98","53e9a415b7602d9702d2d959","53e99d8eb7602d970264bba6","53e9b3bcb7602d9703ea6281","53e9bdb3b7602d9704a63257","53e9b79fb7602d97043486cb","53e9a90db7602d970325df8d"],"Bias in the estimation of false discovery rate in microarray studies.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti626","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16105901?report=xml&format=text","https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti626","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],["53a002f0831432abcb742bb3",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Bioinformatics",null,null,null,null,0],"21",2005],["17179869419","53e99960b7602d970219fcb9","An on-line signature verification system exploiting global information is presented.

In their seminal work, Sette and Sidney defined nine HLA class I supertypes and claimed that these provide an almost perfect coverage of the entire repertoire of HLA class I molecules. HLA alleles are highly polymorphic and polygenic and therefore experimentally classifying each of these molecules to supertypes is at present an impossible task. Recently, a number of computational methods have been proposed for this task. These methods are based on defining protein similarity measures, derived from analysis of binding peptides or from analysis of the proteins themselves.In this paper we define both peptide derived and protein derived similarity measures, which are based on learning distance functions. The peptide derived measure is defined using a peptide-peptide distance function, which is learned using information about known binding and non-binding peptides. The protein derived similarity measure is defined using a protein-protein distance function, which is learned using information about alleles previously classified to supertypes by Sette and Sidney (1999). We compare the classification obtained by these two complimentary methods to previously suggested classification methods. In general, our results are in excellent agreement with the classifications suggested by Sette and Sidney (1999) and with those reported by Buus et al. (2004). The main important advantage of our proposed distance-based approach is that it makes use of two different and important immunological sources of information-HLA alleles and peptides that are known to bind or not bind to these alleles. Since each of our distance measures is trained using a different source of information, their combination can provide a more confident classification of alleles to supertypes.",[["53f46244dabfaefedbb78c7a",null,"tomboy@cs.huji.ac.il","5b86a359e1cd8e14a3ca0b6b","Tomer Hertz",null,null,null,"0000-0002-0561-1578","School of Computer Science and Engineering  Israel",null,null,null,null,null],["53f439ffdabfaee1c0abe7c0",null,null,"5b86a359e1cd8e14a3ca0b6b","Chen Yanover",null,null,null,"0000-0003-3663-4286","School of Computer Science and Engineering  Israel",null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1093/Bioinformatics/btl324",["Epitope","Similarity measure","Repertoire","Metric (mathematics)","Classification methods","Computational biology","Human leukocyte antigen","Genetics","Peptide binding","Mathematics","Distance measures"],"","1367-4811","2",["hla class i molecule","distance function","similar peptide binding specificities","protein distance function","hla allele","distance measure","identifying hla supertypes","hla class","peptide distance function","similarity measure","defining protein similarity measure","polymorphism","human leukocyte antigen"],"en",53,"55","e148","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/227/210/144/53e99967b7602d97021aa74e_0.pdf",["53e9aa0fb7602d970337e893","53e9b16db7602d9703bf2f70","53e9981db7602d9702039c13","53e9a301b7602d9702c09e28","53e9bb93b7602d97047d85d0","558a504fe4b0b32fcb361446","53e9b8d4b7602d97044b3b15","53e9a7feb7602d970313e6c3","53e9b8c6b7602d97044a3a9f","53e99d28b7602d97025db627","53e9a85cb7602d97031a9ac2","53e99efbb7602d97027c9734","53e9a79eb7602d97030d7eae"],"Identifying HLA supertypes by learning distance functions.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/Bioinformatics/btl324","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237084?report=xml&format=text","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],["53a002f0831432abcb742bb3",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Bioinformatics",null,null,null,null,0],"23",2007],["5f71b3291c455f439fe40ec0","53e99967b7602d97021ac4e9","With impressive progress in Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solving and several extensions to pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, many applications that use SAT, such as high-performance formal verification techniques are still restricted to checking satisfiability of certain conditions. However, there is also frequently a need to express a preference for certain solutions. Extending SAT-solving to Boolean optimization allows the use of objective functions to describe a desirable solution. Although recent work in 0-1 Integer Linear Programming (ILP) offers extensions that can optimize a linear objective function, this is often achieved by solving a series of SAT or ILP decision problems. Our work articulates some pitfalls of this approach. An objective function may complicate the use of any symmetry that might be present in the given constraints, even when the constraints are unsatisfiable and the objective function is irrelevant. We propose several new techniques that treat objective functions differently from CNF/PB constraints and accelerate Boolean optimization in many practical cases. We also develop an adaptive flow that analyzes a given Boolean optimization problem and picks the symmetry-breaking technique that is best suited to the problem characteristics. Empirically, we show that for non-trivial objective functions that destroy constraint symmetries, the benefit of static symmetry-breaking is lost but dynamic symmetry-breaking accelerates problem-solving in many cases. We also introduce a new objective function, Localized Bit Selection (LBS), that can be used to specify a preference for bit values in formal verification applications.",[["53f42c87dabfaedce54b88fe",null,null,"5b86b6dbe1cd8e14a34d6779","Fadi A.

By dynamic programming along the associated branch- or tree-decomposition one can solve most graph optimization problems in time linear in the graph size and exponential in the parameter. If one of these parameters is bounded on a class of graphs, then so is the other, but they can differ by a small constant factor and this difference can be crucial for the resulting runtime. In this paper we introduce semi-nice tree-decompositions and show that they combine the best of both branchwidth and treewidth. We first give simple algorithms to transform a given tree-decomposition or branch-decomposition into a semi-nice tree-decomposition. We then give two templates for dynamic programming along a semi-nice tree-decomposition, one for optimization problems over vertex subsets and another for optimization problems over edge subsets. We show that the resulting runtime will match or beat the runtimes achieved by doing dynamic programming directly on either a branch- or tree-decomposition. For example, given a graph G on n vertices with path-, tree- and branch-decompositions of width pw,tw and bw respectively, the Minimum Dominating Set problem on G is solved in time O(n2^m^i^n^{^1^.^5^8^p^w^,^2^t^w^,^2^.^3^8^b^w^}) by a single dynamic programming algorithm along a semi-nice tree-decomposition. On the applied side the immediate gain is that for each optimization problem one can achieve the benefits of both treewidth, branchwidth and pathwidth while developing and implementing only one dynamic programming algorithm. On the theoretical side the combination of the best properties of both branchwidth and treewidth in a single decomposition is a step towards a more general framework giving the fastest possible algorithms on tree-like graphs.",[["53f4338bdabfaec09f160a1e",null,"dorn@informatik.hu-berlin.de","5b86ca76e1cd8e14a3da8793","Frederic Dorn",null,null,null,null,"Institut f√ºr Informatik, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany",null,"5f71b2991c455f439fe3cfc5",["Institut f√ºr Informatik, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Corresponding address: Institut fur Informatik, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Unter den Linden 6, 10099 Berlin, Berlin-Brandenburg, Germany.

For example, a user's demographics, location, and past search and browsing may be useful in enhancing the results offered in response to web search queries. However, reasonable concerns about privacy by both users, providers, and government agencies acting on behalf of citizens, may limit access by services to such information. We introduce and explore an economics of privacy in personalization, where people can opt to share personal information, in a standing or on-demand manner, in return for expected enhancements in the quality of an online service. We focus on the example of web search and formulate realistic objective functions for search efficacy and privacy. We demonstrate how we can find a provably near-optimal optimization of the utility-privacy tradeoff in an efficient manner. We evaluate our methodology on data drawn from a log of the search activity of volunteer participants. We separately assess users preferences about privacy and utility via a large-scale survey, aimed at eliciting preferences about peoples willingness to trade the sharing of personal data in returns for gains in search efficiency.

The most frequently occurring relationship type was the hypernym (e.g., Katherine Hepburn is an actress). The aim of the present work, therefore, was to develop a method for determining a person's occupation from syntactic data in a text corpus. First, in the P-System, we compared predicate‚Äìargument data involving a proper name for different occupations using Okapi's BM25 weighting algorithm. When classifying actors and using sufficiently frequent names, an accuracy of 0.955 was attained. For evaluation purposes, we also implemented a standard apposition-based classifier (A-System). This performs well, but only if a particular name happens to appear in apposition with the corresponding occupation. Last, we created a hybrid (H-System) which combines the strengths of P with those of A. Using data with a minimum of 100 predicate‚Äìargument pairs, H performed best with an overall lenient accuracy of 0.750 while A and P scored 0.615 and 0.656, respectively. We therefore conclude that a hybrid approach combining information from different sources is the best way to predict occupations. ¬© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",[["53f323b4dabfae9a84464e83",null,"richard.sutcliffe@ul.ie","5b86c4dce1cd8e14a3b21836","Kieran White",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",null,"5f71b2951c455f439fe3ce06",["Univ Limerick, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Limerick, Ireland"],null,null],["53f42d17dabfaec22ba137d9",null,null,"5b86c4dce1cd8e14a3b21836","Richard F.

The purpose of CEP is the identification of patterns of events with logical, temporal or causal relationships out of single occurring events. The Rete algorithm is commonly used in rule-based systems to trigger certain actions if a corresponding rule holds. It allows for a high number of rules and is therefore ideally suited for event processing systems. However, traditional Rete networks are limited to operations such as unification and the extraction of predicates from a knowledge base. There is no support for temporal operators. We propose an extension of the Rete algorithm for support of temporal operators. Thereby, we are using interval time semantics. We present the issues created by this extension as well as our pursued methodology to address them. A description language is used to specify the patterns of interest. This specification is also called subscription to a complex event.

Since WSNs consists of a number of sensor nodes with limited capabilities, previous studies mainly discuss on how to send the data efficiently and do not consider the group mobility of mobile sinks that move together staying closely and randomly move within a geographically restricted region. Although the existing multicasting protocols could be applied, they suffer from high congestion and control overhead due to location updates by individual mobile sinks. Geocasting protocols are effective for data delivery to a sink group within a restricted region, but do not guarantee since they only focus on transmitting data to all nodes within a stationary region. Therefore, we propose Region Based Data Dissemination (RBDD) scheme to address these problems. RBDD provides efficient data dissemination scheme for mobile sink groups, so it guarantees data transmission when a sink group does not only move as a whole, but its member sinks also move inside of the region or outside of it. Simulation results show that RBDD guarantees data delivery to a mobile sink group.",[["53f439c5dabfaeee229ca39f",null,"hjlee9@cclab.cnu.ac.kr",null,"Hyungjoo Lee",null,null,null,null,"Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea",null,null,["Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea"],null,null],["53f43114dabfaee2a1cabb90",null,null,null,"Jeongcheol Lee",null,null,null,null,"Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea",null,null,["Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea"],null,null],["53f66276dabfae439e2b560d",null,null,null,"Sang-Ha Kim",null,null,null,null,"Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea",null,null,["Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea"],null,null],["53f458e6dabfaedd74e37c24",null,null,null,"SungKee Noh",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684154",["Mobile computing","Mobile radio","Computer science","Computer network","Dissemination","Multicast","Wireless sensor network","Geocast","Sink (computing)","Mobile telephony","Distributed computing"],"978-1-4244-5637-6","1930-529X E-ISBN : 978-1-4244-5637-6","",["protocols","sensor nodes","region based data dissemination scheme","mobile sinks","mobile sink groups","sensing data","mobile radio","wireless sensor networks","multicasting protocols","data dissemination","data transmission","mobile communication","wireless sensor network","mobile computing"],"en",6,"5","1",null,["53e9a93fb7602d97032943f1","557fb58bf6678c77ea22b17d","53e999c3b7602d970220b647","53e9a38fb7602d9702c9bc06","53e9a711b7602d970304636b","53e99bcdb7602d9702478bd8","53e9aa48b7602d97033b7da1"],"Region Based Data Dissemination Scheme for Mobile Sink Groups in Wireless Sensor Networks",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5684154","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],["555037577cea80f954182982",null,null,null,null,null,null,"GLOBECOM",null,null,null,null,0],"",2010],["5f71b3da1c455f439fe45ceb","53e9998bb7602d97021cfa6f","Implications of a formal context obey Armstrong rules, which allows one to define a minimal (in the number of implications) implication basis, called Duquenne-Guigues basis or stem base in the literature.

Here we tested the role of predator removal on the contemporary evolution of prey traits such as movement, reproduction and foraging. We use EcoSim simulation which allows complex intra- and inter-specific interactions, based on individual evolving behavioral models, as well as complex predator‚Äìprey dynamics and coevolution in spatially homogenous and heterogeneous worlds. We model organisms' behavior using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) that are coded in their genomes which has a clear semantics making reasoning about causality of any evolved behavior possible. We show that the contemporary evolution of prey behavior owing to predator removal is also accompanied by prey genetic change. We employed machine learning methods, now recognized as holding great promise for the advancement of our understanding and prediction of ecological phenomena. A classification algorithm was used to demonstrate the difference between genomes belonging to prey coevolving with predators and prey evolving in the absence of predation pressure. We argue that predator introductions to naive prey might be destabilizing if prey have evolved and adapted to the absence of predators. Our results suggest that both predator introductions and predator removal from an ecosystem have widespread effects on the survival and evolution of prey by altering their genomes and behavior, even after relatively short time intervals. Our study highlights the need to consider both ecological and evolutionary time scales, as well as the complex interplay of behaviors between trophic levels, in determining the outcomes of predator‚Äìprey interactions.",[["53f433a8dabfaee0d9b4a5da",null,"khater@uwindsor.ca",null,"Marwa Khater",null,null,null,null,"School of Computer Science,University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON, Canada",null,"5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0f7",["School of Computer Science,University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON, Canada","Corresponding author."],null,null],["53f43868dabfaec09f18fe3f",null,null,null,"Dorian Murariu",null,null,null,null,"Department of Biology, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON, Canada",null,"5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0f7",["Department of Biology, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON, Canada"],null,null],["54057ca8dabfae92b41da635",null,null,null,"Robin Gras",null,null,null,"0000-0002-0563-0250","School of Computer Science, Department of Biology University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Canada",null,"5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0f7",["School of Computer Science, Department of Biology University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Canada","Great Lake Institute for Environmental Research, University of Windsor, Canada"],null,null]],"10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.02.005",["Trophic level","Ecology","Coevolution","Predation","Biology","Prey switching","EcoSim","Predator","Foraging","Ecosystem"],"","1574-9541","",["Individual-based modeling","Predator‚Äìprey systems","Non-lethal effects","Machine learning","Predator removal"],"en",11,"22","13",null,["53e9a9d8b7602d97033370f8","558c070ee4b02b9f07a4a743","53e9a19ab7602d9702a8e032","53e9b7cdb7602d970437be9c","53e9b879b7602d970444a04e","53e9aa0fb7602d970337a805","53e997fcb7602d970200a98a"],"Contemporary evolution and genetic change of prey as a response to predator removal.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.02.005","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954114000223","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],[null,"1574-9541",null,null,null,null,"Elsevier","Ecological Informatics",null,"ecological-informatics",null,"J",null],"22",2014],["34359744218","53e99991b7602d97021d2292","The purpose of this paper is twofold.

Fifty patients are going to use the patient-specific website for six months. At study begin; realistic treatment goal(s) for elevated risk factors are made between patients and the NP. Patients can enter new measurements and are stimulated to keep regular e-mail contact. The NP personally replies during working days and gives regular but protocol driven feedback and support. Data will be collected on login attempts, amount of messages, risk factor levels before and after intervention and on beliefs. Determinants of changing behaviour are collected. Results: The results can be expected at the beginning of 2007. Conclusion: This pilot-study will give insight in feasibility and satisfaction of patients and NP in electronically treatment of risk factors.

An onboard vision system should take weather effects into account. The effects of daylight fog vary across the scene and are exponential with respect to the depth of scene points. Because it is not possible in this context to compute the road scene structure beforehand, contrary to fixed camera surveillance, a new scheme is proposed. Fog density is first estimated and then used to restore the contrast using a flat-world assumption on the segmented free space in front of a moving vehicle. A scene structure is estimated and used to refine the restoration process. Results are presented using sample road scenes under foggy weather and assessed by computing the visibility level enhancement that is gained by the method.

We show that the first interpretation is captured by existing postulates for merging. But the second interpretation is not, and this leads to the introduction of a new disjunction postulate (Disj). It turns out that existing operators satisfying (Disj) do not perform well with respect to the standard criteria used to evaluate merging operators: logical properties, computational complexity and strategy-proofness. To fill this gap, we introduce two new families of propositional merging operators, quota operators and Gmin operators, which satisfy (Disj), and achieve interesting trade-offs with respect to the logical, computational, and strategy-proofness criteria.",[["53f435fadabfaeb1a7bf02cb",null,"patricia.everaere@univ-lille1.fr","5b86bc18e1cd8e14a3734934","Patricia Everaere",null,null,null,null,"LIFL - CNRS, Universit√© de Lille 1, France",null,"5f71b6b61c455f439fe59e22",["LIFL ‚Äì CNRS, Universit√© de Lille 1, France"],null,null],["5406a2d0dabfae44f084a7f3",null,"konieczny@cril.fr","5b86b9c3e1cd8e14a3626e67","S√©bastien Konieczny",null,null,null,"0000-0002-2590-1222","CRIL - CNRS, Universit√© d'Artois, France",null,"5f71b4091c455f439fe4720e",["CRIL ‚Äì CNRS, Universit√© d'Artois, France","Corresponding author."],null,null],[null,null,"marquis@cril.fr","5b86b9c3e1cd8e14a3626e67","Pierre Marquis",null,null,null,null,"CRIL - CNRS, Universit√© d'Artois, France",null,"5f71b4091c455f439fe4720e",["CRIL ‚Äì CNRS, Universit√© d'Artois, France"],null,null]],"10.1016/j.artint.2010.05.001",["Unanimity","Logical connective","Artificial intelligence","Operator (computer programming)","Merge (version control)","Agr√©gation","Mathematics","Computational complexity theory"],"","0004-3702","12-13",["new family","interesting trade-offs","natural requirement","gmin operator","strategy-proofness criterion","new disjunction postulate","aggregating information","logical property","computational complexity","unanimity condition","satisfiability"],"en",38,"849","824","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1283/890/1351/53e99998b7602d97021da103_0.pdf",["53e9b66cb7602d97041d52b3","53e999fab7602d97022401bc","53e9ba84b7602d97046a5d09","53e99c37b7602d97024e840f","5c7839044895d9cbc6877f4e","53e9ba39b7602d970464a5a5","56d8183adabfae2eee80819c","53e99b26b7602d97023bd343","53e99a5cb7602d97022c4887","53e9a5fdb7602d9702f29c05","53e9af60b7602d970399f5ff","53e9a44fb7602d9702d6b680","53e9bde9b7602d9704a9b638","53e9a3dbb7602d9702ceecf8","53e9aef7b7602d970392663b","53e9b2f4b7602d9703db3330","53e99f27b7602d97027f14b9"],"Disjunctive merging: Quota and Gmin merging operators",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2010.05.001","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370210000706","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],["555036e77cea80f9541662c7",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Artif.

The data may be utilized by the decision support systems in logistics; nevertheless, often there is an information integration problem. The problems with information interchange are related to issues with exchange between independently designed data systems. The networked supply chains will need appropriate IT architectures to support the cooperating business units utilizing structured and unstructured big data and the mechanisms to integrate data in heterogeneous supply chains.

In some cases, a ship hull can be entirely designed with the use of developable surfaces. In this paper, a method to create a quasi-developable B-spline surface between two limit curves is presented. The centreline, chines and sheer lines of a vessel are modelled as B-spline curves. Between each pair of these boundary curves or directrix lines, the generator lines or rulings are created and a quasi-developable B-spline surface containing the rulings is defined. A procedure based on multiconic development is used to modify the directrix lines in case the rulings intersect inside the boundary curves, avoiding non-developable portions of the surface. B-spline curves and surfaces are widely used today in practically all the design and naval architecture computer programs. Some examples of ship hulls entirely created with developable surfaces are presented.",[["5602513245cedb3395f6a228",null,null,"5b86bcade1cd8e14a3775f43","F.

Natural language processing (NLP) methods can be very useful for automatically extracting knowledge such as gene-drug interactions, offering researchers immediate access to published findings, and allowing curators a shortcut for their work. We present a corpus of gene-drug interactions for evaluating and training systems to extract those interactions. The corpus includes 551 sentences that have a mention of a drug and a gene from about 600 journals found to be relevant to pharmacogenomics through an analysis of gene-drug relationships in the PharmGKB knowledgebase. We evaluated basic approaches to automatic extraction, including gene and drug co-occurrence, co-occurrence plus interaction terms, and a linguistic pattern-based method. The linguistic pattern method had the highest precision (96.61%) but lowest recall (7.30%), for an f-score of 13.57%. Basic co-occurrence yields 68.99% precision, with the addition of an interaction term precision increases slightly (69.60%), though not as much as could be expected. Co-occurrence is a reasonable baseline method, with pattern-based being a promising approach if enough patterns can be generated to address recall.

Methods based on hand-coded rule sets are laborous to build and not very reliable. This problem has led to an increasing interest in intrusion detection techniques based upon machine learning or data mining. However, traditional data mining based intrusion detection systems use single classifier in their detection engines. In this paper, we propose a meta learning based method for intrusion detection by MultiBoosting multi classifiers. MultiBoosting can form decision committees by combining AdaBoost with wagging. It is able to harness both AdaBoost's high bias and variance reduction with wagging's superior variance reduction. Experiments results show that MultiBoosting can improve the detection performance of state-of-art machine learning based intrusion detection techniques. Furthermore, we present a Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) based method for reducing network connection features to make MultiBoosting more efficient in real-time network environment, in the meanwhile, keep the detection performance unundermined and in some cases, even further improved.",[["53f42f4bdabfaee2a1c9490d",null,null,"5b86b6e2e1cd8e14a34d9c6c","Rongfang Bie",null,null,null,null,"College of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, P.R.

From a software point of view, wireless sensor networks need to be managed in many different ways; e.g. power consumption in each sensor, efficient data routing, sensing and data sending interval, etc. Our approach gives the network a more structured model, and manages the former issues using multi-agent system concepts. In our model, we propose a new method for sensor power management which we call Neighbors Power Comparison (NPC). We defined 4 different power thresholds, and when the sensor's power meets each one of these thresholds a power reduction algorithm will try to reduce the amount of energy used by sensor. We also cover the whole life-time process of a sensor network using our model.",[["53f45ca5dabfaee4dc8293ba",null,null,"5b86b756e1cd8e14a350d044","Ahmad Hosseingholizadeh",null,null,null,null,"Ryerson University",null,"5f71b4d01c455f439fe4cac1",null,null,null],["54093153dabfae450f469623",null,null,"5b86b756e1cd8e14a350d044","Abdolreza Abhari",null,null,null,null,"Ryerson University",null,"5f71b4d01c455f439fe4cac1",null,null,null]],"",["Sensor node","Key distribution in wireless sensor networks","Power management","Visual sensor network","Brooks‚ÄìIyengar algorithm","Real-time computing","Mobile wireless sensor network","Engineering","Sensor web","Wireless sensor network"],"","","",["different way","structured model","different power threshold","power reduction algorithm","new agent-based solution","wireless sensor network","power consumption","sensor network","efficient data","sensor power management","wireless sensor networks management","routing","agent","multi agent system"],"en",12,"","",null,["53e9b110b7602d9703b909d2","53e9ae22b7602d9703836457","53e9b181b7602d9703c0aaec","53e9ad3bb7602d970371c5bc","53e9a7b3b7602d97030f1992","53e99a67b7602d97022d790c","53e99ca8b7602d9702558790"],"A new agent-based solution for wireless sensor networks management",["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1639809.1639910"],["53a726b120f7420be8b7ec4f",null,null,"Spring Simulation Multiconference",null,null,null,"SpringSim",null,null,null,null,0],"",2009],["42949682557","53e9999eb7602d97021e4c0d","This paper presents recent advances in a compiler infrastructure to map algorithms described in a Java subset to FPGA-based platforms.

The method uses simulated annealing to achieve a nearly optimal allocation of production rules onto processor nodes. The approach balances the initial rule distribution to avoid higher communication demand among processor nodes at run time. A formal mapping model is developed and a new cost function is defined for the annealing process. New heuristic swap functions and cooling policies are provided to ensure the quality of the annealing process. A software load balancing package, SIMAL, was implemented on a SUN workstation to carry out the benchmark experiments. The overhead associated with this mapping method is O ( m In m ), where m is the number of rules in the production system. Two benchmark production systems, Toru-waltz and Tourney , are mapped onto a hypercube computer with 32 nodes. Experimental benchmark results verify the effectiveness of the rule mapping method. The method can be applied for distributed artificial intelligence processing or for the parallel execution of cooperating expert systems on a message-passing multicomputer.",[["53f591ebdabfaedf3cf80465",null,null,"5b8699bbe1cd8e14a38929f0","Jian Xu",null,null,null,null,"Storage Systems Products Division, IBM Corporation, 5600 Cottle Road, San Jose, California 95193, USA",null,"5f71b5c41c455f439fe532ea",null,null,null],[null,null,null,"5b8699bbe1cd8e14a38929f0","Kai Hwang",null,null,null,null,"Storage Systems Products Division, IBM Corporation, 5600 Cottle Road, San Jose, California 95193, USA",null,"5f71b5c41c455f439fe532ea",null,null,null]],"10.1016/0743-7315(91)90102-F",["Simulated annealing","Heuristic","Rule-based system","Load balancing (computing)","Computer science","Parallel computing","Expert system","Workstation","Software","Hypercube"],"","0743-7315","4",["rule based system","simulated annealing"],"en",20,"455","442",null,["53e9b783b7602d9704328456","53e9b7c7b7602d970437303e","53e9b3ceb7602d9703ebe3df","53e9ac54b7602d970362503c","53e9a042b7602d970292ab9c","53e9bc15b7602d970487d881","53e9b042b7602d9703aa009f","53e9bdbfb7602d9704a70767"],"Mapping rule-based systems onto multicomputers using simulated annealing",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0743-7315(91)90102-F","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],[null,"0743-7315",null,null,null,null,null,"JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING",null,"JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING",null,"J",null],"13",1991],["5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e380","53e9999eb7602d97021e576f","Let n and k be integers with n=k=0.

An initial introductory section presents the hopes for e-government and outlines its history in the United States and globally. Section II, \"The New Face of Government,\" examines FirstGov, the premiere example of e-government and surveys its political implications. Section III, \"Issues in Digital Governance,\" discusses such management challenges as privacy rights, e-procurement, e-commerce, and ethics in e-government. Section IV, \"Preparing for Digital Government,\" discusses data warehousing and related prerequisites for e-government, including the education and training of the public service. Finally, Section V, \"The Future of E-Government,\" discusses the digital divide, citizen participation, and factors that will determine the eventual success or failure of the e-government model.</td><td>List(List(null, null, null, 5b869d53e1cd8e14a3a1ddb6, P L Giorgi, null, null, null, null, Dipartimento di Matematica e Applicazioni, Universita degli Studi di Napoli Complesso Monte S.,

Unfortunately, bugs in concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to reproduce because bugs due to concurrency happen under very specific thread schedules and the likelihood of taking such corner-case schedules during regular testing is very low.

We describe a mechanism that helps to hit a concurrent breakpoint in a concurrent execution with high probability.

Daniel L. Hartl and Andrew G. Clark. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Massachusetts. 1997. Pp. 542. Price ¬£39.95, hardback. ISBN 0 87893 306 9. There is demand for a more widespread understanding of population genetics. Many a 'health scare of the week' highlights the lack of public understanding of population processes. Areas ranging from law enforcement through agricultural and medical practice to biological conservation now require some expertise in population genetics. Does this book promise to satisfy the demand? Star qualities are immediately apparent: enthusiasm for the subject, a clear overview, and a universal style. Such qualities did not arise overnight. The two previous editions were considered to be the leading modern text for advanced undergraduates and beginning postgraduates. However, I feel that the presentation is too ambitious for most undergraduates, especially for those with no background. For such, Professor Hartl's Primer in Population Genetics (2nd edn) from the same publisher will provide a more accessible introduction. To make life simpler, education tends towards telling a linear story. Population genetics on the other hand resembles a multidimensional jigsaw puzzle: its language is a colourful amalgam of physical mechanisms, mathematical models, and statistical descriptions. This text deals with the conflict by dividing the subject into its major processes and applications. Nonetheless, the authors try to emphasize connectedness: for example, between inbreeding and genetic drift. Another recurring theme is the current deficit in our understanding of the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation. The third edition introduces many changes in structure and content. The effect is to give a better flow from background concepts through processes to applications. The genetic system at the centre of attention is the classical gene in an outbreeding diploid. Nonetheless, glimpses are provided of other systems, such as selfing plants, transposable elements and bacterial chromosomes. The first two chapters provide the genetic and statistical background. The resolution of the conflict between the biometrical and Mendelian views of inheritance by Sir Ronald Fisher is inserted to give the subject a historical perspective. Chapters three to seven form the core of the book, and describe the main influences on genetic variation, including the relationship between gene and genotype, population subdivision, inbreeding, mutation, recombination and migration. Chapter six provides a panorama of Darwinian selection, from single gene models, through the mutation-selection balance and interactions with genetic drift, to all the complexities of age-structured populations and epistasis. The long-standing debate about the relative roles of selection and drift in adaptive evolution is referred to without the reader becoming enmeshed, and Kimura's neutral theory is accorded the role of universal null hypothesis in this context. The reader is given a taste of the diffusion theory which identified the equilibrium states of the classical literature, and which led to the latest coalescence models. Chapters eight and nine deal with two major applications of population genetic theory: molecular evolution and quantitative genetics. The use of insights from the neutral theory to interpret protein and DNA sequence data is described, as are the methods for gene tree construction. Important applications of gene trees are described: for hypothesis tests of the direction of organismal trait evolution, for estimation of long-term migration rates, and for demonstrating selection at the gene level over evolutionary time scales. Quantitative genetics is given the standard presentation: the definition of heritability, and the estimation of components of genetic variance. The use of dense linkage maps for locating quantitative trait loci is presented as one way to elucidate the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation. The book ends on this characteristically optimistic note. This book is essential reading for anyone requiring a firm foundation in modern population genetics. Arabidopsis Protocols (Methods in Molecular Biology 82). Jos√© M. Mart√≠nez-Zapater and Julio Salinas (eds). Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey. 1998. Pp. 440. Price $79.50, hardback. ISBN 0 89603391 0. Arabidopsis Protocols represents a timely publication that is aimed to fill a niche within a market full of plant molecular biology-related titles. Interest in Arabidopsis as an experimental model for higher plants has increased exponentially since the mid-1980s and is set to rise even further with the impending completion of its genome project soon after the millennium. The strongly nucleic acid-related theme within many chapters of the book reflects the array of techniques that are currently being employed by the international Arabidopsis community to map and clone their target genes. However, Arabidopsis Protocols does far more than provide solace for the loneliness of the long-distance chromosome walker. Initial chapters provide basic, yet important, information for new Arabidopsis researchers ‚Äî how to grow this weed successfully! This section includes useful chapters by Mary Anderson describing the control of Arabidopsis pests and diseases, plus Randy Scholl and colleagues detail how they preserve the longevity of Arabidopsis seed. In contrast, Part 2 proved disappointing. Whilst I commend the editors for including chapters describing the purification of Arabidopsis organelles and macromolecules, I was surprised to discover that Arabidopsis cells only contain mitochondrial and chloroplast organelles and that their macromolecules are totally nucleic acid-based! The inclusion of a chapter describing the subfractionation of Arabidopsis cellular membranes would have gone a long way towards balancing this section. Part 3 proved excellent reading, particularly the chapters on seed mutagenesis and genetic analysis which included useful introductory discussions, whilst Part 4 comprehensively describes PCR and RFLP-based techniques used to map Arabidopsis genes and mutations. Transient and stable Arabidopsis transformation techniques provide the theme for Part 5, including a description of vacuum-based in planta, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation by Bechtold and Pelletier. However, I was surprised to see no reference being made to detergent-based in planta transformation methodologies which are currently gaining favour amongst many Arabidopsis laboratories. Commendably, the treatment of gene cloning within Part 6 was well balanced, contrasting chromosome walking and landing strategies with transposon and T-DNA-based gene tagging approaches. The final section addresses techniques used to study Arabidopsis gene expression including a selection of chapters describing in situ hybridisation, reporter genes and, particularly enjoyable, in vivo footprinting. However, I was disappointed that the editors did not include a chapter on the localisation of those well known DNA by-products, proteins! This omission emphasises the overall nucleic acid-based theme within Arabidopsis Protocols. Whilst it is fair to say that the majority of Arabidopsis researchers are presently engrossed with nucleic acid-related topics, there is a growing interest in post-transcriptional processes. In summary, Arabidopsis Protocols provides an excellent technical reference for molecular geneticists, old and new, and will represent a 'must-have' text for every Arabidopsis laboratory for the next decade. Principles of Genome Analysis (2nd edn). S. B. Primrose. Blackwell Science, Oxford. 1998. Pp 193. Price ¬£19.50, paperback. ISBN 0 632 04983 9. S. B. Primrose has authored or co-authored several books like this one: heavily illustrated texts of between 100 and 200 pages on subjects related to gene manipulation. Each is aimed at a broad market ‚Äî students, lecturers or researchers interested in understanding, or considering entry to, the fields in question. All provide references to both the original literature and to appropriate reviews (about 400 references are cited in this volume). The two most successful, Introduction to Modern Virology (latterly with Dimmock) and Principles of Gene Manipulation (with Old) are in their 4th and 5th editions, respectively, and have increased in size several fold (to about 400 pages). Principles of Gene Manipulation is used as a teaching text in this University. Each of these books was last updated in 1994. Principles of Genome Analysis, subtitled A Guide to Mapping and Sequencing DNA from Different Organisms was first published in 1995 and has now been republished in revised, although not much lengthened, form. The subject of this volume is, of course, extremely timely. With public interest in human genome analysis reaching heights unprecedented for a problem in fundamental biological research, and with both large-scale commercial and government funding earmarked for the sequencing and analysis of the genomes of dozens of different species, the constituency of those interested in this volume should be both large and diverse. The book is divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1 attempts both to explain the benefits of genome sequencing, from the lofty ('detailed understanding of the organism will only be achieved when every gene has been identified and its transcript and the timing of transcript synthesis known') to the practical (a more efficient way to find disease genes). It also lists sequencing projects which are underway, describes some techniques, and outlines the rest of the book. I found Chapter 2 on the organization and structure of genomes (with the lowest density of 'practical' information) the most interesting. As one more familiar with prokaryotes, the complexity and variability (even amongst related species) of eukaryotic DNA organization creates for me a bewildering picture: why does the cow have a genome which harbours 25% tandemly repeated DNA? Why is mammalian DNA heavily punctuated with functionally inactive interspersed repeats? Why do introns vary in size and frequency between species? Chapter 3 is a straightforward exposition of methods for subdividing chromosomes into minichromosomes and other vectors as a preliminary to sequencing and gene mapping. Chapter 4 offers a real challenge to the novice; it presents a veritable alphabet soup (fortunately there is an abbreviations list at the start of the book) of ingenious methods for assembling physical maps. I think, for the non-expert, it is more to be dipped into than assimilated. Chapter 5, on sequencing, began as a welcome relief but progressed to an explication of sequencing on microchips which defeated me. Chapter 6, on sequence analysis and new to this edition, is only 12 pages long and surprisingly, considering the subject matter of the rest of the book, concentrates primarily on bacterial genome sequences with heavy reference to the publications of Koonin and collaborators. Others are more circumspect than he at declaring pairs of genes homologous and the impression is perhaps given here that genes (and their functions) are more conserved between species than may eventually prove to be the case. The final chapter deals with finding genes in the DNA-haystack of large genomes. The text is well illustrated with mostly useful diagrams (some borrowed from Principles of Gene Manipulation), although some were hard to understand, and with a lesser number of tables (I would have liked more). There are a number of proof-reading errors, omissions (several references are absent from the reference lists) difficult or inadequate figure captions and the occasional misstatement, but these do not seriously detract from the usefulness of the book. Although I suspect that private purchases may be limited, this is certainly a volume with a place in every comprehensive biology library. Genetic Structure and Local Adaptation in Natural Insect Populations. Susan Mopper and Sharon Y. Strauss (eds). Chapman and Hall, New York. 1997. Pp. 449. Price ¬£65.00, hardback. ISBN 041208031 1. Some 30 years ago, three seminal papers were published that have steered subsequent work on insect/plant interactions. First, Hairston, Smith & Slobodkin (now known as HSS, 1960) published a short note based on the observation that 'the world is green' and that the nature of population regulation depends on the trophic level examined. This work sparked research and controversy eventually leading to debates on the role of competition vs. other forces in structuring ecological communities. Following HSS, Ehrlich & Raven (1964) made the case for reciprocal coevolution between plants and insects, prompting investigations into the role of phytochemistry in insect/plant interactions, as well as phylogenetic tests of macro-evolutionary cospeciation between insects and plants. Finally, Bush (1969) stirred the pot with evidence from plant associated flies of sympatric speciation, a topic that remains controversial to this day. Now, 30 years later, we are wondering where this field stands. For the past decade, Denno & McClure's (1983) Variable Plants and Herbivores in Natural and Managed Systems and Strong, Lawton & Southwood's (1984) Insects on Plants provided the backbone for this discipline. In this volume, Mopper and Strauss have offered a much-needed update to these well-worn bibles of insect/plant interactions. It is an impressive collection of well-edited papers that focus on the genetic issues at the heart of insect/plant interactions, and in particular the importance of demic adaptation. In the past third of a century, the field has matured, not coincidentally as a result of more sophisticated genetic techniques as well as methods of analysis. So, what's new? Several themes emerge. As Boecklen & Mopper (Ch. 4) point out, the proper designs to test for local adaptation are now recognized, and the relevant data are pulled together here for the first time. Picture insects feeding on plants. First, selection for adaptation to host plants can be strong enough to overcome most scenarios of gene flow (Strauss & Karban, Ch. 8), and, as a result, local adaptation can occur at several possible scales, for example, individual plants, plant species, and sites (Mopper, Ch. 7). Local adaptation can lead to the formation of demes (Alstad, Ch. 1; Stiling & Rossi, Ch. 2), but not always (Cobb &Whitham, Ch. 3; Boecklen & Mopper, Ch. 4; Hanks & Denno, Ch. 11). Dispersal, or lack thereof, is critical in permitting local adaptation (Mopper, Ch. 7; Strauss & Karban, Ch. 8, Hanks & Denno, Ch. 11; Thomas & Singer, Ch. 14). Feeding style (Stiling & Rossi, Ch. 2), inherited environmental effects (Rossiter, Ch. 6), social behaviour and other intrademic structure (McCauley & Goff, Ch. 9; Costa, Ch. 10), life history patterns (Peterson & Denno, Ch. 12), and many sorts of habitat heterogeneity (Gandon et al., Ch. 13), all influence the magnitude of gene flow if not the likelihood of local adaptation. Finally, host fidelity can act as a reproductive barrier to gene flow either partially (Thomas & Singer, Ch. 14; Itami et al., Ch. 15) or nearly completely (Feder et al., Ch. 16). Given that the book is a solid and important contribution to the field, is anything missing? The mechanisms underlying adaptation have received little attention by the contributors and are 'conspicuous by their absence' (Berenbaum & Zangerl, Ch. 5). This criticism may be valid‚Äìreciprocal transplant studies used to detect local adaptation often make it difficult to distinguish among various selective mechanisms. However, this is a criticism of the field rather than the book. One promising area that was overlooked in the book is the use of phylogenetics or genealogies to understand the evolution of host associations, although Itami et al. (Ch. 15) come close. With regards to organization, I have four reservations about the volume. First, the collection of papers is dominated by North American schools of insect/plant studies ‚Äì 15 of 16 papers; the 16th, Gandon et al., is out of France. Second, the authors missed an opportunity to comment on the chapters ‚Äî the four sections would have benefited from both synthesis and perspective. Third, the index is thin at seven pages, compared to 37 pages in Denno & McClure (albeit a larger volume) and 20 pages in Strong, Lawton & Southwood (a smaller volume) which included a very useful author index, an unfortunate omission here. Fourth, and this one is for the publishers, ¬£65.00 is beyond the grasp of most graduate students worldwide. Does it really cost this much to produce an edited volume of 16 papers when academics write these chapters for free? That said, who will want to read the book? I would recommend the book as required reading for anyone interested in insect/plant interactions. Perhaps more importantly, it is an outstanding source of ideas. The perfect target would be students in a seminar setting, or a grant-starved professor submitting another proposal on insect/plant interactions (thank you!), or a beginning PhD student looking for a project. But, for those of you whose daily encounters with entomofauna is a splat on the windshield and the millennium bug, there is still a lot here ‚Äî genetic differentiation, selection, adaptation, speciali-zation, life-history variation, speciation, and biodiversity. There is no doubt this field is evolving quickly, so read the book and keep up with the Red Queen! Melanism: Evolution in Action. Michael E. N. Majerus. Oxford University Press, Oxford. 1998. Pp. 338. Price ¬£23.95, paperback. ISBN 0 19 854982 2. The classical example of natural selection at work concerns melanism (the occurrence of dark forms). Probably all biologists have heard about 'the peppered moth story', first published by Kettlewell in Heredity. The simple version of the story is that once upon a time there were two forms of the peppered moth (Biston betularia), a common white one and a rare black one. When pollution made tree trunks black, more whites than blacks were eaten by birds, and since then most peppered moths in industrial areas are black. If you suspect that the reality is not as simple as that you are right. The moths, for example, do not normally rest on tree trunks, and intermediate forms exist. Michael Majerus dissects the story in his book on melanism and shows that it is more complex and fascinating than most biologists will have realized. The book starts with general principles. First what melanism is and its possible causes, then principles of genetics and finally those of evolutionary processes. Readers of Heredity can skip the genetic part, unless they want to have a clearly written text that explains genetics at the very basic level. Likewise the evolutionary part: it is basic, but might be suitable in a course for first year students. The remainder of the book is on melanism in specific groups of organisms. First two chapters on the peppered moth, then two on other moths, and finally a large chapter on ladybirds. The reason for the choice of organisms is not that melanism is restricted to them, but simply that the author happens to work on them. Is the book therefore only of interest to those who work on moths and ladybirds? Surely not! By ignoring the book workers on other organisms would make the same mistake that Majerus did, missing interesting and important work outside their own realm. The author states in the preface that one of his original goals was to 'update Kettlewell' but that this was not achievable in one book. Instead he has 'used only those examples known to me to illustrate the points I have tried to make'. His real aim then was to engender renewed interest in melanism. But he could have done a better job in this respect. By sticking to his 'own organisms' he missed the opportunity to highlight several important topics related to melanism. There is, for example, nice work on plasticity in melanism, and on the relationship between the darkness of wings and mate locating behaviour in butterflies. The author apparently also missed the fact that the forms of the scarlet tiger moth (Panaxia dominula) are mainly determined by temperature, thereby making it useless as an illustration of balanced polymorphism. The book is almost exclusively on cases of melanism with discrete forms determined by a few alleles. Heritabilities are hardly mentioned, although there exists work dealing with continuous variation, even in 'his own' ladybirds. I found the last section on 'the future of research into melanism' disappointing. I think that the most exciting opportunities arise by integrating different biological disciplines.

The defeasibility of rules is expressed by means of non-provability claims as additional conditions of the rules.We outline an abstract approach to defeasible reasoning and argumentation which includes many existing formalisms, including default logic, extended logic programming, non-monotonic modal logic and auto-epistemic logic, as special cases. We show, in particular, that the `admissibility' semantics for all these formalisms has a natural argumentation-theoretic interpretation and proof procedure, which seem to correspond well with informal argumentation.In the admissibility semantics there is only one way for one argument to attack another, namely by undermining one of its non-provability claims. In this paper, we show how other kinds of attack between arguments, specifically how rebuttal and priority attacks, can be reduced to the undermining of non-provability claims.</td><td>List(List(53f436b8dabfaeb2ac055cb2, null, null, 5b869d98e1cd8e14a3a39683, Robert A.

If such a matrix is dened over a principal ideal domain, this is equivalent to con- sidering its Smith normal form or its cokernel. Many variations of the enumeration methods result in equivalent matrices. In particular, Gessel-Viennot matrices are equivalent to Kasteleyn-Percus matrices. We apply these ideas to plane partitions and related planar of tilings. We list a number of conjectures, supported by experiments in Maple, about the forms of matrices associated to enumerations of plane partitions and other lozenge tilings of planar regions and their symmetry classes. We focus on the case where the enumerations are round or q-round, and we conjecture that cokernels remain round or q-round for related \\impossible enumerations\" in which there are no tilings. Our conjectures provide a new view of the topic of enumerating symmetry classes of plane partitions and their generalizations. In particular we conjecture that a q- specialization of a Jacobi-Trudi matrix has a Smith normal form.

The MSC.Software code Patran was used as the pre and post processor, and the MSC.Software code Dytran as the computational engine. The Catia model was not suitable for meshing, but the geometry therein was transferred to a new group and became the basis for the model. With further study of copies of the large engineering drawings, a faithful replica of the Comanche tailcone was constructed. The final geometry consists of 56 surfaces and 10 solids. The tailcone structure is meshed with 25,261 Lagrangian elements (16,665 2-D shell elements plus 8,596 3-D solid elements) of edge length 1 inch. The fluid region is meshed with 22,113 3-D solid Eulerian elements of edg e length 2 inches. The model has 5 different 2-D orthotropic materials, which are used to construct the laminate composites for the shell elements. It also uses an aluminum material for some shell elements. The vents' shell elements are modeled with an e xtremely weak material, so that the inner surface forms a closed volume (required in Dytran). A 3 -D orthotropic material is assigned to the solid Lagrangian elements. Material properties of air are assigned to the Eulerian elements. Generic (unclassified) initial properties are used for the sphere containing the blast wave. A job was run and graphical results were inserted into the final report.</td><td>List(List(53f4cbc7dabfaee57a78192a, null, null, 5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cb83c, Donald A.

In this work we introduce a role-based approach for ad hoc teamwork, in which each teammate is inferred to be following a specialized role that accomplishes a specific task or exhibits a particular behavior. In such cases, the role an ad hoc agent should select depends both on its own capabilities and on the roles currently selected by other team members. We present methods for evaluating the influence of the ad hoc agent's role selection on the team's utility and we examine empirically how to choose the best suited method for role assignment in a complex environment. Finally, we show that an appropriate assignment method can be determined from a limited amount of data and used successfully in new tasks that the team has not encountered before.</td><td>List(List(53f43819dabfaee02acd9ff6, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598, Katie Genter, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at Austin, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf, null, null, null), List(53f434b5dabfaeecd694fcdf, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598, Noa Agmon, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at Austin, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf, null, null, null), List(53f42d28dabfaeb2acfe712a, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598, Peter Stone, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at Austin, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf, null, null, null))</td><td></td><td>List(Teamwork, Computer science, Knowledge management, Human‚Äìcomputer interaction)</td><td>0-9817381-3-3</td><td></td><td></td><td>List(role assignment, appropriate assignment method, specialized role, common goal, role selection, complex environment, present method, team member, team setting, limited amount)</td><td>en</td><td>1</td><td>1252</td><td>1251</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997d7b7602d9701fd0004_0.pdf</td><td>List(53e9a309b7602d9702c14b8b, 53e99858b7602d970208f24f, 53e9aa61b7602d97033d4b67, 53e9a1e1b7602d9702ae0e7e, 53e9a6cab7602d9702fff64d)</td><td>Role selection in ad hoc teamwork</td><td>List(http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2343948)</td><td>List(555037187cea80f954172d7a, null, null, null, null, null, null, AAMAS, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2831c455f439fe3c61e</td><td>53e997ddb7602d9701fd2cce</td><td>A social e-book provides not only the original text but also other readers&' comments, and it enables social interactions inside the book.

The research objective is to find the tendencies of reader generated annotations during two social reading projects. For theoretical background, \"the significance of the text - social interaction model\" was used for the analysis conducted in this study, and we classified user generated annotations into three different types. As a result, participants had a tendency to make more annotations about their understanding and appreciation than regarding text interpretation. In addition, the result shows that the social e-book can promote fine-grained interactions. Regarding the comparison of the genres of the contents, the group of people who read the classic and humanities genre is more active than those who read the popular literature genre. For future study, more specific ways to improve interest and understanding will be examined for effective collaborative reading experiences through the social e-book.</td><td>List(List(53f466afdabfaeee22a54847, null, null, 5b868af8e1cd8e14a32924f3, Seyeon Lee, null, null, null, null, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, South Korea, null, 5f71b2831c455f439fe3c61e, null, null, null), List(53f467fadabfaedd74e6ffbd, null, null, 5b868af8e1cd8e14a32924f3, Jea In Kim, null, null, null, null, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, South Korea, null, 5f71b2831c455f439fe3c61e, null, null, null), List(53f43a87dabfaee02acf230a, null, null, 5b868af8e1cd8e14a32924f3, Chung-Kon Shi, null, null, null, null, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, South Korea, null, 5f71b2831c455f439fe3c61e, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/978-3-642-39371-6_6</td><td>List(Social group, Social relation, World Wide Web, Social media, Collaborative learning, Future study, Psychology, Social learning, Epistemology, Social competence)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(social reading project, reader experience, original text, collaborative learning, text interpretation, social interaction model, social e-book, effective collaborative reading experience, social interaction, future study, classic humanities text)</td><td>en</td><td>0</td><td>57</td><td>50</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b86db7602d9704439294, 53e9b130b7602d9703bb0b59, 53e9b39db7602d9703e80f29)</td><td>Assessing the possibility of a social e-book by analyzing reader experiences</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39371-6_6)</td><td>List(53a7261520f7420be8b66689, null, null, International Conference on Online Communities and Social Computing, null, null, null, HCI (26), null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2a91c455f439fe3d54a</td><td>53e997e3b7602d9701fd8790</td><td>Alembic is a comprehensive information extraction system that has been applied to a range of tasks.

Indeed, by analyzing brain electrical activity online, several groups have designed brain-actuated systems that provide alternative channels for communication, entertainment and control. Thus, a person can write messages using a virtual keyboard on a computer screen and also browse the internet. Alternatively, subjects can operate simple computer games, or brain games, and interact with educational software. Researchers have also been able to train monkeys to move a computer cursor to desired targets and also to control a robot arm. Work with humans has shown that it is possible for them to move a cursor and even to drive a mobile robot between rooms in a house model. In this talk I will review the field of BCI, with a focus on non-invasive systems based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. I will also describe three brain-actuated applications we have developed: a virtual keyboard, a brain game, and a mobile robot (emulating a motorized wheelchair). Finally, we discuss current research directions we are pursuing in order to improve the performance and robustness of our BCI system, especially for real-time control of brain-actuated robots.</td><td>List(List(53f45b24dabfaee4dc8240c6, null, null, 5b86b6c5e1cd8e14a34cc1d8, Jos√© del R.

Different from user-first methods where user makes decision before any processing, ADD allows user to\n make decision based on an initial solution.

The report card is computed for two sets of journals, the top-20 journals in JCR 2010 and the top-20 journals in JCR 2010 for the category Information and Library Science.</td><td>List(List(53f42de5dabfaedf4351d6f1, null, Judit.Bar-Ilan@biu.ac.il, 5b86a5e4e1cd8e14a3d9d2c3, Judit Bar-Ilan, null, null, null, 0000-0002-8796-5248, Department of Information Science, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel 52900, null, 5f71b2ad1c455f439fe3d77c, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/s11192-012-0671-3</td><td>List(World Wide Web, Ranking, Computer science, Report card, Impact factor)</td><td></td><td>0138-9130</td><td>2</td><td>List(Journal report card, Median, 90% percentile, Synchronous h-index for journals)</td><td>en</td><td>13</td><td>260</td><td>249</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9aafab7602d970347cf44, 53e99df0b7602d97026af7d4, 53e9b16db7602d9703bf5a4b, 53e9b0c2b7602d9703b338af, 53e9bc26b7602d970488f163, 53e99f0ab7602d97027d873d, 53e9a9d3b7602d97033335eb, 53e99e80b7602d97027481fa, 53e9b5e7b7602d970413abe7, 53e99924b7602d970215ec79, 53e9b7cdb7602d970437d65c, 53e9b9a0b7602d9704590d23)</td><td>Journal report card</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-012-0671-3, http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-012-0671-3, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-012-0671-3, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(5390acc420f70186a0eb9ddc, null, null, null, null, null, null, Scientometrics, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>92</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b52a1c455f439fe4f3ef</td><td>53e997f8b7602d9701ffcbef</td><td>The hypergraph augmentation problem is to augment a hypergraph by hyperedges to meet prescribed local connectivity requirements.

We show that appropriate states cannot be obtained by density operators in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. However, using techniques for the description of infinitely many degrees of freedom from field theory and statistical mechanics, such states can nevertheless be constructed rigorously. We explore two related possibilities, namely an extended notion of algebras of observables, and the use of singular states on the algebra of bounded operators.

At this early stage of development, only overall goals of features are understood, and there is a need to discover all possible scenarios of operation. We have developed a formalism - Structured Transition Systems (STS) - that facilitates the rapid evolution of specifications. STS supports multiple idioms of specification : transitions, state-diagrams, scenarios etc. It also supports constructs for hierarchical organization of a specification. We have further defined analyses that are useful for review and inspection of STS specifications. A distinctive feature of our method is the ability to use analysis results to refine and reinforce parts of the specification by importing analysis results into STS specifications. In practice, this leads to a feedback loop where requirements can be rapidly refined using analysis engines to drive the development of requirements. We have experimented using our technique on a number of automotive case-studies, and we present some of our experiences with these case-studies.</td><td>List(List(54302a26dabfaeca69bd07ca, null, null, 5b8698e8e1cd8e14a38325e2, Sampath, P., null, null, null, null, India Sci.

It has been argued in the literature that ''a marriage of classical cutting planes and tree search is out of the question as far as the solution of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems is concerned'' [16] because the cuts generated at one node of the search tree need not be valid at other nodes. We show that it is possible, by using a simple lifting procedure, to make Gomory cuts generated at a node of the enumeration tree globally valid in the case of mixed 0-1 programs. The procedure essentially amounts to treating the variables fixed at 0 or 1 as if they were free. We also show why this lifting procedure is not valid for general (other than 0-1) mixed integer programs. Other issues addressed in the paper are of a computational nature, such as strategies for generating the cutting planes, deciding between branching and cutting, etc. The result is a robust mixed integer program solver.</td><td>List(List(53f48444dabfaec09f2a69bb, null, null, 5b86ad3de1cd8e14a3096f9d, E.

SVD is powerful at finding the global solution to the associated least-square-error minimization problem. However, this is the correct error to minimize only when the x and y positional errors in the features are uncorrelated and identically distributed. But this is rarely the case in real data. Uncertainty in feature position depends on the underlying spatial intensity structure in the image, which has strong directionality to it. Hence, the proper measure to minimize is covariance-weighted squared-error (or the Mahalanobis distance). In this paper, we describe a new approach to covariance-weighted factorization, which can factor noisy feature correspondences with high degree of directional uncertainty into structure and motion. Our approach is based on transforming the raw-data into a covariance-weighted data space, where the components of noise in the different directions are uncorrelated and identically distributed. Applying SVD to the transformed data now minimizes a meaningful objective function in this new data space. This is followed by a linear but suboptimal second step to recover the shape and motion in the original data space. We empirically show that our algorithm gives very good results for varying degrees of directional uncertainty. In particular, we show that unlike other SVD-based factorization algorithms, our method does not degrade with increase in directionality of uncertainty, even in the extreme when only normal-flow data is available. It thus provides a unified approach for treating corner-like points together with points along linear structures in the image.</td><td>List(List(54406eaadabfae805a6bd3ad, null, null, 5b8694a4e1cd8e14a367346f, P.

All kinds of systems, either with or without a state, can be modelled in a simple way. An attempt is made to devise executable models that are amenable to mathematical proofs. Apart from testing, proving is a viable technique for establishing correctness of algorithms. There exists a clear link to systems theory. Some restrictions have to be imposed on systems theory to obtain executability, but these restrictions are fewer than assumed normally when systems are described in imperative programming languages.

Execution times of traditional approaches are exponential in the number of FSM inputs. We develop a new heuristic algorithm to generate UIO sequences for FSMs with binary inputs.

In other applications, like medical diagnosis, abstaining from making a prediction may be more desirable than making an incorrect prediction. In this paper we consider different types of reliable classifiers suited for such situations. We formalize the notion and study properties of reliable classifiers in the spirit of agnostic learning (Haussler, 1992; Kearns, Schapire, and Sellie, 1994), a PAC-like model where no assumption is made on the function being learned. We then give two algorithms for reliable agnostic learning under natural distributions. The first reliably learns DNFs with no false positives using membership queries. The second reliably learns halfspaces from random examples with no false positives or false negatives, but the classifier sometimes abstains from making predictions.</td><td>List(List(53f49d50dabfaebfa677b67a, null, adum@microsoft.com, 5b86ca91e1cd8e14a3db52c6, Adam Tauman Kalai, null, null, null, null, Microsoft Research, Cambridge, MA, USA, null, 5f71b2831c455f439fe3c634, List(Microsoft Research, Cambridge, MA, USA, Part of this research was done while the author was at Georgia Institute of Technology, supported in part by NSF SES-0734780, and NSF CAREER award, and a SLOAN Fellowship.), null, null), List(53f42feadabfaee02ac80b39, null, vkanade@fas.harvard.edu, 5b86cf65e1cd8e14a3feabb2, Varun Kanade, null, null, null, 0000-0002-2300-4819, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, null, 5f71b4501c455f439fe491ff, List(School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, Corresponding author., This research was done while the author was at Georgia Institute of Technology, supported in part by NSF CCF-0746550.), null, null), List(53f4bcb4dabfaeda9b77b79d, null, mansour@tau.ac.il, 5b86b6d3e1cd8e14a34d2759, Yishay Mansour, null, null, null, null, School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, null, 5f71b28d1c455f439fe3ca38, List(School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, This work was supported in part by the IST Programme of the European Community, under the PASCAL2 Network of Excellence, by a grant from the Israel Science Foundation and by a grant from United States‚ÄìIsrael Binational Science Foundation (BSF).

Mobile devices redirect the design goal from cost performance to cost-performance-per-watt. Smaller transistors don't help because they are too expensive and because they leak too much. The microprocessor has effectively stalled hardware design for thirty years, and it will not be the workhorse in mobile devices of the future.

For example, it has been proven in the 1960's that size-based scheduling policies that give priority to short jobs are optimal with respect to mean response time. Yet, virtually no systems today implement these policies. One reason is that real systems are significantly more complex than a theoretical M/M/1 or M/G/1 queue and it is not obvious how to implement some of these policies in practice. Another reason is that there is a fear that the big jobs will \"starve\", or be treated unfairly as compared to Processor-Sharing (PS). In this article we show, using two important real world applications, that size-based scheduling can be used in practice to greatly improve mean response times in real systems, without causing unfairness or starvation.

In this chapter, we conduct a systematic study on models and algorithms in sequential pattern analysis, especially discuss the existing algorithms‚Äô advantages and limitations.

Several interesting results have also been shown for SSI form concerning liveness analysis and the representation of live-ranges of variables, which could make SSI form appealing for just-in-time compilation. Unfortunately, we have uncovered several mistakes in the previous literature on SSI form, which, admittedly, is already quite sparse. This article corrects the mistakes that are most germane to SSI form. We first explain why the two definitions of SSI form proposed in past literature, first by C. S. Ananian, then by J. Singer, are not equivalent. Our main result is then to prove that basic blocks, and thus program points, can be totally ordered so that live-ranges of variables correspond to intervals on a line, a result that holds for both variants of SSI form. In other words, in SSI form, the intersection graph defined by live-ranges is an interval graph, a stronger structural property than for SSA form for which the intersection graph of live-ranges is chordal. Finally, we show how this structure of live-ranges can be used to simplify liveness analysis.</td><td>List(List(53f4464adabfaee1c0aec34f, null, benoit.boissinot@ens-lyon.org, 5b86b6eae1cd8e14a34dd431, Benoit Boissinot, null, null, null, null, ENS-Lyon, null, 5f71b29a1c455f439fe3d033, List(UCB Lyon 1, ENS Lyon, CNRS, UMR,LIP,Compsys Team,Inria 5668, Lyon, France), null, null), List(54058678dabfae92b41dfd75, null, null, 5b86c411e1cd8e14a3ac7a9e, Philip Brisk, null, null, null, 0000-0003-0083-9781, University of California, Riverside, null, 5f71b2931c455f439fe3ccff, List(Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA), null, null), List(53f352a6dabfae4b3494ef01, null, null, 5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cb8ce, Alain Darte, null, null, null, null, CNRS, null, 5f71b28c1c455f439fe3c9b4, List(UCB Lyon 1, ENS Lyon, CNRS, UMR,LIP,Compsys Team,Inria 5668, Lyon, France), null, null), List(53f4c98adabfaee9caf80708, null, null, 5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca1e9, Fabrice Rastello, null, null, null, null, Inria, null, 5f71b29a1c455f439fe3d023, List(UCB Lyon 1, ENS Lyon, CNRS, UMR,LIP,Compsys Team,Inria 5668, Lyon, France), null, null))</td><td>10.1145/2180887.2180898</td><td>List(Interval graph, Control flow graph, Computer science, Chordal graph, Algorithm, Theoretical computer science, Compiler, Intersection graph, Intermediate language, Static single assignment form, Liveness)</td><td></td><td>1539-9087</td><td>1</td><td>List(past literature, main result, interval graph, ssi form, liveness analysis, previous literature, ssa form, numerous compiler analysis, interesting result, ssi properties revisited, intersection graph, static single assignment, intermediate representation, control flow graph, total order, just in time compiler)</td><td>en</td><td>12</td><td>ArticleNo.21</td><td>ArticleNo.21</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9ba4ab7602d970465f31f, 53e9aee5b7602d9703913955, 599c7f1c601a182cd28ef2d1, 53e99a85b7602d97022f8854, 53e9bd76b7602d9704a1696e, 53e9bbd5b7602d9704827fa0, 53e9b2d2b7602d9703d808fa, 53e99d87b7602d97026424cc, 53e9ad48b7602d970372e86e, 53e9b2f4b7602d9703db13ce, 53e9ac5bb7602d970362911b, 53e9a914b7602d970326534d, 53e9a051b7602d9702936edd, 53e9a539b7602d9702e5eef4, 53e9aeaab7602d97038cbf42, 53e9a81fb7602d97031681bc, 53e9a317b7602d9702c1eb91, 53e9a699b7602d9702fcd99d, 53e9bd92b7602d9704a39950, 53e9b394b7602d9703e75b90, 53e99b04b7602d9702393a8c, 53e9a97bb7602d97032d6747)</td><td>SSI Properties Revisited</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2180887.2180898, http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2180887.2180898, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(555036cf7cea80f954158d34, null, null, null, null, null, null, ACM Trans.

In order to improve the efficiency of constraint solving, techniques that learn during search, such as constraint weighting\n and nogood learning, have been proposed. Constraint weights can be used to guide heuristic choices. Nogood assignments can\n be avoided by adding additional constraints. Both of these techniques can be used in either one-shot systematic search, or\n in a setting in which we frequently restart the search procedure. In this paper we propose a third way of learning during\n search, generalising previous work by Freuder and Hubbe. Specifically, we show how, in a restart context, we can guarantee\n that we avoid revisiting a previously visited region of the search space by extracting it from the problem. Likewise, we can\n avoid revisiting inconsistent regions of the search space by extracting inconsistent subproblems, based on a significant improvement\n upon Freuder and Hubbe‚Äôs approach. A major empirical result of this paper is that our approach significantly outperforms \n\n\n\n\n\n mac\\mbox{\\sc mac} combined with weighted degree heuristics and restarts on challenging constraint problems. Our approach can be regarded as\n an efficient form of learning that does not rely on constraint propagation.

To remedy this, combinatorial auctions permit bids on bundles of goods.

Our development of MGoI depends on a new theory of partial traces, as well as an abstract notion of orthogonality (related to work of Hyland and Schalk.) In this paper we recall the MGoI semantics for MLL, and discuss how it relates to denotational semantics of MLL in certain *-autonomous categories. Finally, we prove characterization theorems for the MGoI interpretation of MLL in partially traced categories with an orthogonality, and for the original untyped GoI interpretation of MLL in a traced unique decomposition category.</td><td>List(List(53f438ecdabfaec22ba99719, null, null, 5b86a735e1cd8e14a3e25af8, Esfandiar Haghverdi, null, null, null, null, School of Informatics, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47408, USA, null, 5f71b2981c455f439fe3cf0b, null, null, null), List(53f42fb6dabfaedce54e2c42, null, null, 5b86c825e1cd8e14a3c9bcbf, Philip J.

In this work, we address this problem from the model substitutability point of view, through model typing. We introduce four mechanisms to achieve model substitutability, each formally defined by a subtyping relation. We then discuss how to declare and check these subtyping relations. This work provides a formal reference specification establishing a family of model-oriented type systems.

Well-known examples include the kernel density estimate (KDE) for density estimation and the support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We propose a kernel classifier that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a \"difference of densities.\" We focus on the Gaussian kernel, although the method applies to other kernels suitable for density estimation. Like a support vector machine (SVM), the classifier is sparse and results from solving a quadratic program. We provide statistical performance guarantees for the proposed L2 kernel classifier in the form of a finite sample oracle inequality and strong consistency in the sense of both ISE and probability of error. A special case of our analysis applies to a previously introduced ISE-based method for kernel density estimation. For dimensionality greater than 15, the basic L2 kernel classifier performs poorly in practice. Thus, we extend the method through the introduction of a natural regularization parameter, which allows it to remain competitive with the SVM in high dimensions.

There are three main benefits in the proposed approach: (1) the structure of a service and involved data types are considered in the matching process, (2) the providers do not need to spent considerable effort annotating the service description using tags or ontology models, and (3) both the crisp similarity and fuzzy similarity can be produced automatically.</td><td>List(List(53f43042dabfaee02ac84ffc, null, albert@ntou.edu.tw, null, Shang-Pin Ma, null, null, null, 0000-0002-3317-5750, Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Keelung, Taiwan, null, null, List(Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Keelung, Taiwan), null, null), List(53f447dddabfaec09f1ceec8, null, null, null, Jonathan Lee, null, null, null, null, Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan, null, null, List(Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan), null, null))</td><td>10.1109/APSEC.2012.143</td><td>List(Graph theory, Ontology, Metadata, Computer science, Data type, Web service, Database, Service-oriented architecture, WS-Policy, Web Coverage Service)</td><td>978-1-4673-4930-7</td><td>1530-1362</td><td></td><td>List(service matchmaking approach, fuzzy set theory, ontology model, service signature graph, web service matchmaking, service description, web services, crisp similarity, request graph, web service discovery, service-oriented architecture, graph-based web service matchmaking, fuzzy similarity, ontologies (artificial intelligence), tags model, loosely-coupled soa, graph theory, ssg, graph-based approach, wsdl, web service, service requesters, service oriented architecture)</td><td>en</td><td>3</td><td>801</td><td>796</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e99a4eb7602d97022ae6d5, 53e9bb67b7602d97047a88ac, 53e9a9fdb7602d9703368df0, 53e99b21b7602d97023babba, 53e9a974b7602d97032cf9c2, 53e9b8ccb7602d97044aacdc, 53e998f0b7602d970212bc6a, 53e99a5cb7602d97022c6e98)</td><td>A Graph-Based Approach to Web Service Matchmaking</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2012.143, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6462748, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(53a724a620f7420be8b36796, null, null, null, null, null, null, APSEC, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>1</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6e9</td><td>53e9984bb7602d970207e700</td><td>Verification seeks to prove or refute putative properties of a given program. Deductive verification is carried out by constructing a proof that the program satisfies its specification, whereas model checking uses state exploration to find computations where the property fails. Model checking is largely automatic but is effective only for programs defined over small state spaces. Abstraction serves as a bridge between the more general deductive methods for program verification and the restricted but effective state exporation methods used in model checking. In verification by abstraction, deduction is used to construct a finite-state approximation of a program that preserves the property of interest. The resulting abstraction can be explored for offending computations through the use of model checking.

Ideally, these queries should represent coherent, conceptually well-separated topics. We provide an abstract formulation of the query decomposition problem, and we tackle it from two different perspectives. We first show how the problem can be instantiated as a specific variant of a set cover problem, for which we provide an efficient greedy algorithm. Next, we show how the same problem can be seen as a constrained clustering problem, with a very particular kind of constraint, i.e., clustering with predefined clusters. We develop a two-phase algorithm based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering followed by dynamic programming. Our experiments, conducted on a set of actual queries in a Web scale search engine, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.</td><td>List(List(53f36a35dabfae4b349a9165, null, null, null, Francesco Bonchi, null, null, null, null, Yahoo!

In contrast to previous work, we do not assume that F is convex, and in fact make no assumptions at all about F. By necessity this means that we work in the property testing model; we seek an algorithm which, given parameters A and Œµ, satisfies: ‚Ä¢ if surf (F) ‚â§ A then the algorithm accepts (whp); ‚Ä¢ if F is not Œµ-close to some set G with surf (G) ‚â§ Œ∫A, then the algorithm rejects (whp). We call Œ∫ ‚â• 1 the \\\"approximation factor\\\" of the testing algorithm. The n = 1 case (in which \\\"surf(F) = 2m\\\" means F is a disjoint union of m intervals) was introduced by Kearns and Ron [KR98], who solved the problem with Œ∫ = 1/Œµ and O(1/Œµ) oracle queries. Later, Balcan et al. [BBBY12] solved it with with Œ∫ = 1 and O(1/Œµ4) queries. We give the first result for higher dimensions n. Perhaps surprisingly, our algorithm completely evades the \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\": for any n and any Œ∫ > 4/œÄ &ap; 1.27 we give a test that uses O(1/Œµ) queries. For small n we have improved bounds. For n = 1 can achieve Œ∫ = 1 with O(1/Œµ3.5) queries (slightly improving [BBBY12]), or any Œ∫ > 1 with O(1/Œµ) queries (improving [KR98]). For n = 2, 3 we obtain Œ∫ &ap; 1.08, 1.125 respectively, with O(1/Œµ) queries. Getting an arbitrary Œ∫ > 1 for n > 1 remains an open problem. Finally, motivated by the learning results from [KOS08], we extend our techniques to obtain a similar tester for Gaussian surface area for any n, with query complexity O(1/Œµ) and any approximation factor Œ∫ > 4/œÄ &ap; 1.27.</td><td>List(List(53f4ceb9dabfaeed1af820af, null, null, null, Pravesh Kothari, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at Austin, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf, null, null, null), List(53f38999dabfae4b34a2834e, null, null, null, Amir Nayyeri, null, null, null, null, Carnegie Mellon University, null, 5f71b2861c455f439fe3c771, null, null, null), List(53f43462dabfaee02acb6db9, null, null, null, Ryan O'Donnell, null, null, null, null, Carnegie Mellon University, null, 5f71b2861c455f439fe3c771, null, null, null), List(53f438eedabfaee02ace2bab, null, null, null, Chenggang Wu, null, null, null, null, Tsinghua University, null, 5f71b2881c455f439fe3c860, null, null, null))</td><td>10.5555/2634074.2634163</td><td>List(Combinatorics, Open problem, Property testing, Oracle, Curse of dimensionality, Regular polygon, Gaussian surface, Disjoint union, Mathematics)</td><td>978-1-61197-338-9</td><td></td><td></td><td>List(algorithms, design, general, theory, geometrical problems and computations)</td><td>en</td><td>15</td><td>1214</td><td>1204</td><td></td><td>List(53e99f03b7602d97027d123a, 558c4f46e4b00c3c48e18ae9, 558a8bbfe4b037c08757c523, 53e9a938b7602d970328d1aa, 53e9ad1fb7602d97036ffc53, 53e9b96fb7602d97045600b8, 53e99822b7602d9702043bb0, 53e99d65b7602d9702623280, 53e99f20b7602d97027eb42e, 53e99ae2b7602d970236b0d8, 53e9a863b7602d97031ac9e4, 53e9ad1fb7602d97036fd8d6, 558bb87fe4b0cfb70a19741d, 53e9b527b7602d970405e7da, 53e9ae36b7602d970384d728, 53e99fbcb7602d9702893bda, 53e9b3a3b7602d9703e842b8, 53e9ab69b7602d970350457c)</td><td>Testing surface area</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611973402.89, http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2634074.2634163&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=521561572&CFTOKEN=81175169&preflayout=flat, https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2634074.2634163)</td><td>List(53a7292120f7420be8bc52bf, null, null, null, null, null, null, SODA, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b3681c455f439fe42aa4</td><td>53e99853b7602d97020881eb</td><td></td><td>List(List(53f7c08bdabfae90ec11a7f4, null, null, 5b86b6c7e1cd8e14a34cccf4, C.

Used in a retroactive way, it is meant to assess liability issues pertaining to an existing piece of technology that has already reached the deployment stage.

These approaches shortened the distance between the artificial and the natural mind by stressing the importance of the unity between the brain, the body and the environment. At the same time, nowadays robotic researchers openly acknowledge the importance of experience which has been not sufficiently considered in the recent past. The process went so far that the field of machine consciousness is now part of the scientific landscape. The externalist approach identifies experience with relations, processes or acts between an agent and its environment. Externalism is the view according to which the brain and its neural activity is necessary but not sufficient to produce the conscious mind. The externalist approach locates the subject and experience processes in a context wider than brain-oriented approaches. Because of this fact, the externalist standpoints allows to start from methodological and ontological premises suitable for the study of experience and of other subjective contents inside an experimental framework. The talk will review the externalist-oriented approaches and it will present the main ideas at the basis of the emerging field of externalist robotics. The aims of this research is to experiment, in a circumscribed number of cases, whether it is possible to apply such an architecture in the fields of robotics, of psychology and of philosophy of mind.</td><td>List(List(54088a85dabfae450f4264db, null, antonio.chella@unipa.it, null, Antonio Chella, null, null, null, 0000-0002-8625-708X, Univ Palermo, DICGIM, Viale Sci Bldg 6, I-90128 Palermo, Italy, null, 5f71b28b1c455f439fe3c989, List(Univ Palermo, DICGIM, Viale Sci Bldg 6, I-90128 Palermo, Italy), null, null), List(53f46069dabfaedf4362ebed, null, null, null, Riccardo Manzotti, null, null, null, null, IULM Univ, Inst Consumpt Commun & Behav, I-16033 Milan, Italy, null, 5f71b36a1c455f439fe42b96, List(IULM Univ, Inst Consumpt Commun & Behav, I-16033 Milan, Italy), null, null))</td><td>null</td><td>List(Externalism, Cognitive science, Philosophy, Artificial intelligence, Robotics)</td><td>null</td><td>0922-6389</td><td>null</td><td>List()</td><td>en</td><td>0</td><td>56</td><td>56</td><td></td><td>null</td><td>Towards externalist robotics.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/978-1-60750-959-2-56, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(null, 0922-6389, null, null, null, null, null, BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES 2011, null, BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES 2011, null, J, null)</td><td>233</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2f01c455f439fe3f56f</td><td>53e99858b7602d970208f6b2</td><td>In Ulam's game Paul tries to find one of n possibilities with q Yes-No questions, while responder Carole is allowed to lie a fixed number k of times.

Our work treats each website and all pages from the site as a single entity and classifies the entire website as opposed to a single page or a set of pages. We analyze both the textual features including terms, part-of-speech bigrams and named entities and structural features including the link structure of the site and URL patterns. Our experiments on a large set of websites related to weight loss and obesity control, under a multi-label classification setting using the SVM classifier, reveal that with a careful selection and treatment of features based on keywords, one can achieve an F-measure of 70% and that adding structural, part-of-speech and named entity based features further improves the F-measure to 74%.

We describe how a hierarchical dynamical model of motor function is able to solve the problem of delayed reward in learning movement sequences using associative (Hebbian) learning. At the lowest level, the motor system encodes simple movements or primitives, while at higher levels the system encodes sequences of primitives. During training, the network is able to learn a high level motor program composed of a specific temporal sequence of motor primitives. The network is able to achieve this despite the fact that the reward signal, which indicates whether or not the desired motor program has been performed correctly, is received only at the end of each trial during learning. Use of a continuous attractor network in the architecture enables the network to generate the motor outputs required to produce the continuous movements necessary to implement the motor sequence.</td><td>List(List(53f4398edabfaec22ba9edc8, null, null, 5b869097e1cd8e14a34d0bf8, S.

However, the use and development of cloud services has not been standardized, thereby deriving in migratability and interoperability difficulties. Different standardization initiatives exist seeking to normalize this situation, however none has predominated and a generalized consensus has not been reached. Consequently, several alternatives have been proposed based on the use of intermediate layers or middlewares seeking to isolate developers from the variability of specific cloud vendor services. These approaches provide a valid solution at the risk of shifting the lock-in effect from vendors to middlewares. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution based on the use of software adaptation (SA) techniques.

The accurate measure of trust and reputation is a hard problem, most of the existing trust mechanisms adopt the historical behavior feedback to compute trust and reputation. Thus exploring the appropriate transaction behavior becomes a fundamental challenge. In P2P system, each peer plays two roles: server and client with responsibility for providing resource service and trust recommending respectively. Considering the resource service behavior and trust recommending behavior of each peer, in this paper, we propose a new trust model adopting the technology to calculate eigenvectors of trust rating and recommending matrices. In our model, we define recommended reputation value to evaluate the resource service behavior, and recommending reputation value to evaluate the trust recommendation behavior. Our algorithm would make these two reputation values established an interrelated relation of reinforcing mutually. The normal peers provide authentic file uploading services, as well as give correct trust recommendation, so they can form a trusted and cooperative transaction community via the mutual reinforcement of recommended and recommending reputation values. In this way, the transaction behaviors of those malicious peers are isolated and confined effectively. Extensive experimental results also confirm the efficiency of our trust model against the threats of exaggeration, collusion, disguise, sybil and single-behavior.</td><td>List(List(53f45045dabfaee2a1d5bc9f, null, xinxinyuanfan@gmail.com, 5b869cc2e1cd8e14a39de7dd, Xinxin Fan, null, null, null, null, School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116620, Liaoning, PR China, null, 5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e34f, List(School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116620, Liaoning, PR China, Corresponding author.

Fixing the average total transmission power from the network and preserving fairness among the selected relays by constraining them to transmit with equal average powers, we aim to improve the signal reception quality at the far-field receiver by means of a proper choice of the relays. Assuming that the nodes' forward channels are not known, the following three relay selection schemes are proposed and their performances are analyzed. 1) Optimal relay selection scheme that maximizes the average SNR at the receiver by exploiting K nodes with the highest SNRs as relays; 2) geometry-based relay selection scheme that is energy-efficient and achieves a close-to-optimal average SNR performance at the receiver by using K closest nodes to the source as relays; and 3) random relay selection scheme that is energy-efficient and further guarantees a fair usage of all nodes by randomly selecting K relays from a specific area around the source. By minimizing an outage probability, a strategy to determine this area is also proposed. Finally, it is shown for all relay selection schemes that the SNR variance at the receiver converges to zero as K increases.</td><td>List(List(53f369b3dabfae4b349a7472, null, f_etezad@encs.concordia.ca, null, Farrokh Etezadi, null, null, null, null, Concordia Univ, ECE Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada, null, null, List(Concordia Univ, ECE Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada), null, null), List(53f435fcdabfaec22ba7dd47, null, null, null, Keyvan Zarifi, null, null, null, null, Concordia Univ, ECE Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada, null, null, List(Concordia Univ, ECE Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada, INRS EMT, Montreal, PQ, Canada), null, null), List(53f4327cdabfaee43ec072a2, null, null, null, Ali Ghrayeb, null, null, null, null, Concordia Univ, ECE Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada, null, null, List(Concordia Univ, ECE Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada), null, null), List(53f43961dabfaedf4359c08a, null, null, null, Sofi√®ne Affes, null, null, null, 0000-0002-1729-3503, INRS EMT, Montreal, PQ, Canada, null, null, List(INRS EMT, Montreal, PQ, Canada), null, null))</td><td>10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683926</td><td>List(Total transmission, Topology, Relay channel, Computer science, Signal-to-noise ratio, Computer network, Communication channel, Network topology, Outage probability, Wireless sensor network, Relay)</td><td></td><td>1930-529X</td><td></td><td>List(amplify and forward communication, error statistics, telecommunication network topology, wireless sensor networks, geometry-based relay selection scheme, homogeneously distributed wireless sensor networks, multirelay amplify-and-forward cooperative communication scheme, node forward channels, optimal relay selection scheme, outage probability, random relay selection scheme, signal reception quality, topology-assisted techniques)</td><td>en</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e9985fb7602d9702099ee0_0.pdf</td><td>List(53e9bd46b7602d97049d4aee, 53e9b36cb7602d9703e4a6ee, 53e9acbcb7602d9703699d22, 53e9a09fb7602d9702988106, 53e9b2e5b7602d9703d9a4e9, 53e9aa49b7602d97033b8a88, 53e9a938b7602d970328ce90, 53e9b808b7602d97043b9837, 53e9ba95b7602d97046bb93e)</td><td>Topology-Assisted Techniques to Relay Selection for Homogeneously Distributed Wireless Sensor Networks</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683926, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5683926, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(555037577cea80f954182982, null, null, null, null, null, null, GLOBECOM, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2010</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b3e01c455f439fe45fd7</td><td>53e99860b7602d970209c70a</td><td>As e-learning studying is activated, learners' requirements are increased.

Focusing on the spatial assembly sequencing and evaluating, a set of geometric computation methods and algorithms are studied systematically. A method entitled 3D geometric constraint analysis (3D-GCA) is proposed based on the planar GCA method combined with the techniques of oriental bounding boxes and the separation axis theorem. With 3D-GCA, the assembly precedence relations and the spatial geometric feasible assembly sequences can be reasoned out correctly and automatically. Furthermore, four evaluation criteria, viz. assembly angle, assembly direction, reorientation, and stability, and related algorithms are defined for evaluating the assembly's complexity. For selecting the optimal sequence, a comprehensive evaluation function is constructed by integrating the four criteria and the weights are quantitatively allocated referring to fuzzy set theory, clustering analysis, and entropy theory. In addition, a software prototype system is developed and two case assemblies are studied. The analysis results and findings demonstrate that the proposed approaches and algorithms can provide significant assistance in the spatial assembly sequencing and the optimal sequence selection.</td><td>List(List(542be542dabfae2b4e1b3602, null, suq@sjtu.edu.cn, 5b86c9d7e1cd8e14a3d61bd3, Qiang Su, null, null, null, null, Department of Industrial Engineering & Logistics Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang, Shanghai, 200240, China, null, 5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0, List(Department of Industrial Engineering & Logistics Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang, Shanghai, 200240, China, Corresponding address: Department of Industrial Engineering & Management, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang, Shanghai, 200240, China.

One of the significant features in modern networks is differentiated service. Along with differentiated service, rapidly changing network environments result in congestion problems. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of representative congestion control applications - scheduling and queue management algorithms, and we propose application-specific acceleration technique using ILP (instruction level parallelism) and PLP (packet level parallelism). From the ILP perspective, new instruction set extensions for fast conditional operations are applied for congestion control applications. Based on our experiments, proposed architectural extensions show 10-12% improvement in performance for instruction set enhancements. For PLP, we propose a hardware acceleration model based on detailed analysis of congestion control applications. In order to get large throughputs, large number of processing elements and a parallel comparator are designed. Such hardware accelerators provide large parallelism proportional to the number of processing elements added. As the performance of general purpose processors rapidly increases, defining architectural extensions (e.g., MMX as in multimedia applications) for general purpose processors could be an alternative solution for wide range of network applications.</td><td>List(List(53f43011dabfaedd74d58838, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598, Byeong Kil Lee, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at Austin, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf, null, null, null), List(53f45a7cdabfaeb2ac0e55a4, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598, Lizy Kurian John, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at Austin, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6bf, null, null, null), List(53f43adadabfaeee229d5cf5, null, null, 5b86c1e8e1cd8e14a39d25fe, Eugene John, null, null, null, null, The University of Texas at San Antonio, null, 5f71b2ca1c455f439fe3e48a, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/ASAP.2005.16</td><td>List(Instruction-level parallelism, Network service, Network processor, Computer architecture, Instruction set, Computer science, Network packet, Differentiated service, Hardware acceleration, Network congestion, Distributed computing)</td><td>0-7695-2407-9</td><td>2160-0511</td><td></td><td>List(intelligent network application, congestion control, processor scheduling, parallel processing, diffserv networks, network application, scheduling, application-specific acceleration, instruction set extension, network service, modern network, differentiated service, telecommunication congestion control, queueing theory, various network service, instruction level parallelism, network processor, packet level parallelism, general purpose processor, hardware acceleration model, complex network protocol, queue management, architectural support, instruction sets, network processors, congestion problem, accelerating congestion control applications, modern intelligent network application, network environments result, congestion control application, network protocol, intelligent networks, process capability, hardware accelerator, protocols, bandwidth, intelligent network, acceleration, complex networks, communication networks, scheduling algorithm, hardware, complex network, control systems)</td><td>en</td><td>3</td><td>175</td><td>169</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a5fdb7602d9702f28db6, 53e9ab5fb7602d97034f6cd5, 53e9a38fb7602d9702ca0479, 53e9b421b7602d9703f16c73, 53e9af53b7602d9703994625, 53e9b891b7602d9704467c85, 558ac59c84ae84d265bf8c38, 53e9ba54b7602d970466fb7b, 53e99960b7602d97021a5260, 573695d86e3b12023e4efe49, 558a355184ae84d265bc3c70, 53e9a7d5b7602d9703111f81)</td><td>Architectural support for accelerating congestion control applications in network processors</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2005.16, http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ASAP.2005.16, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1540382)</td><td>List(5550373b7cea80f95417ae04, null, null, Application-Specific Systems, Architectures, and Processors, null, null, null, ASAP, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>34359744218</td><td>53e99866b7602d970209e337</td><td>We describe an action planning approach that integrates a system of autonomous dialogue engines with narration and presentation modules to create a multi-modal storytelling environment.

Therefore, it becomes essential to study the behavior of multiprocessor architectures under commercial workloads. To accomplish this, we need simulators able to model not only the CPU, memory and interconnection network but also other aspects that are critical in the execution of commercial workloads, such as I/O subsystem and operating system. In this paper, we present our first experiences using Simics, a simulator which allows full-system simulation of multiprocessor architectures covering all the topics previously mentioned. Using Simics we carry out a detailed performance study of a static web content server, showing how changes in some architectural parameters, such as number of processors and cache size, affect final performance. The results we have obtained corroborate the intuition of increasing performance of a dual-processor web server opposite to a single-processor one, and at the same time, allow us to check out Simics limitations. Finally, we compare these results with those that are obtained on real machines.</td><td>List(List(53f4340bdabfaee02acb30ae, null, fj.villa@ditec.um.es, 5b86bee5e1cd8e14a38782b0, F. J.

This makes it difficult to keep model and its implementation causally connected. We present a new pure reflective component-based programming and modeling language where all core component concepts are treated explicitly and therefore keeping original component-design alive.

By tracking software power consumption we can build models to provide suggestions to avoid power regressions. There is much research on software power consumption, but little focus on the relationship between software changes and power consumption. Most work measures the power consumption of a single software task; instead we seek to extend this work across the history (revisions) of a project. We develop a set of tests for a well established product and then run those tests across all versions of the product while recording the power usage of these tests. We provide and demonstrate a methodology that enables the analysis of power consumption performance for over 500 nightly builds of Firefox 3.6; we show that software change does induce changes in power consumption.

Nonetheless, an aspect that has been largely overlooked so far in the recommender system literature is that of automatically building explanations for a particular recommendation. This paper focuses on the news domain, and proposes to enhance effectiveness of news recommender systems by adding, to each recommendation, an explanatory statement to help the user to better understand if, and why, the item can be her interest. We consider the news recommender system as a black-box, and generate different types of explanations employing pieces of information associated with the news. In particular, we engineer text-based, entity-based, and usage-based explanations, and make use of a Markov Logic Networks to rank the explanations on the basis of their effectiveness. The assessment of the model is conducted via a user study on a dataset of news read consecutively by actual users. Experiments show that news recommender systems can greatly benefit from our explanation module as it allows users to discriminate between interesting and not interesting news in the majority of the cases.</td><td>List(List(53f43468dabfaee4dc76ffaf, null, null, null, Roi Blanco, null, null, null, null, Yahoo!

We used resources available in the FlyBase model organism database; these resources include a curated lists of genes and the articles from which the entries were drawn, together a synonym lexicon. We applied simple pattern matching to identify gene names in the associated abstracts and filtered these entities using the list of curated entries for the article. This process created a data set that could be used to train a simple Hidden Markov Model (HMM) entity tagger.

In Bayesian short-time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimation for single-channel speech enhancement, the spectral components are traditionally assumed uncorrelated. However, this assumption is inexact since some correlation is present in practice. In this paper, we investigate a multidimensional Bayesian STSA estimator that assumes correlated spectral components. Since the closed-form solution of this optimum estimator is not readily available, we alternatively derive closed-form expressions for an upper and a lower bound on the desired estimator. Using these bounds, we propose a new family of speech enhancement estimators that are characterized by a scalar parameter 0 ‚â§ Œ≥ ‚â§ 1, with Œ≥ = 0 corresponding to the lower bound and Œ≥ = 1 to the upper bound. An appropriate estimator for the correlation matrix of the clean speech is further derived. Evaluation results from both objective and subjective speech quality measures show that at moderate to high SNR values, where spectral correlation of speech is most noticeable, the proposed estimators can achieve significant improvements over the traditional STSA and Wiener filter estimators.</td><td>List(List(53f3a58cdabfae4b34ad661c, null, null, 5b86b0a5e1cd8e14a32069a0, E.

To estimate the effects of soft errors on such circuits, we develop a general computational framework based on probabilistic transfer matrices (PTMs). In particular, we apply them to evaluate circuit reliability in the presence of soft errors, which involves combining the PTMs of gates to form an overall circuit PTM. Information such as output probabilities, the overall probability of error, and signal observability can then be extracted from the circuit PTM. We employ algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) to improve the efficiency of PTM operations. A particularly challenging technical problem, solved in our work, is to simultaneously extend tensor products and matrix multiplication in terms of ADDs to non-square matrices. Our PTM-based method enables accurate evaluation of reliability for moderately large circuits and can be extended by circuit partitioning. To demonstrate the power of the PTM approach, we apply it to several problems in fault-tolerant design and reliability improvement.</td><td>List(List(53f46526dabfaedf43641174, null, null, 5b86b6c3e1cd8e14a34cb721, Smita Krishnaswamy, null, null, null, null, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6a8, null, null, null), List(53f42d43dabfaee02ac5f3cb, null, null, 5b86c497e1cd8e14a3b02611, George F.

The array gain gives information on the power offset that results from exploiting channel state information at the transmitter or as a consequence of the channel model. Hence, the diversity, multiplexing, and array gain (DMA) analysis is able to cope with the limitations of the original DMT and provide an operational meaning in the sense that the DMA gains of a particular system can be directly translated into a parameterized characterization of its associated outage probability performance. In this paper, we derive the best DMA gains achievable by any scheme employing isotropic signaling in uncorrelated Rayleigh, semicorrelated Rayleigh, and uncorrelated Rician block-fading MIMO channels.

Bringing a given object into focus is however a long and tedious task, although the underlying optical laws are known. A fundamental parameter is the aperture of the lens entrance pupil because it directly affects the depth of field. The smaller the aperture, the larger the depth of field. However a too small aperture destroys the sharpness of the image because of diffraction on the pupil edges. Hence, the desired optimal configuration of the camera is such that the object is in focus with the greatest possible lens aperture. In this paper, we show that when the object is a convex polyhedron, an elegant solution to this problem can be found. It takes the form of a constrained optimization problem, for which theoretical and numerical results are given. The optimization algorithm has been implemented on the prototype of a robotised view camera.</td><td>List(List(53f38292dabfae4b349fea4b, null, stephane.mottelet@utc.fr, 5b86b46de1cd8e14a33b9858, St√©phane Mottelet, null, null, null, null, Laboratoire de Math√©matiques Appliqu√©es, Universit√© de Technologie de Compi√®gne, Compi√®gne, France 60205, null, 5f71b3551c455f439fe421fb, List(Laboratoire de Math√©matiques Appliqu√©es, Universit√© de Technologie de Compi√®gne, Compi√®gne, France 60205#TAB#), null, null), List(53f437f8dabfaee2a1cf4f57, null, null, null, Luc Saint Germain, null, null, null, null, Luxilon, Saint-Cloud, France 92210, null, 5f71b7af1c455f439fe5df56, List(Luxilon, Saint-Cloud, France 92210#TAB#), null, null), List(53f452a1dabfaec09f1f8738, null, null, null, Olivier Mondin, null, null, null, null, Luxilon, Saint-Cloud, France 92210, null, 5f71b7af1c455f439fe5df56, List(Luxilon, Saint-Cloud, France 92210#TAB#), null, null))</td><td>10.1007/s10851-011-0306-y</td><td>List(Aperture, Computer vision, Computer science, Computational photography, Pupil, Convex polytope, Artificial intelligence, Scheimpflug principle, Diffraction, Entrance pupil, Depth of field)</td><td></td><td>0924-9907</td><td>1</td><td>List(Large format photography, Computational photography, Scheimpflug principle)</td><td>en</td><td>0</td><td>18</td><td>1</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/storage/pdf/arxiv/11/1102/1102.0048.pdf</td><td>null</td><td>Smart Depth of Field Optimization Applied to a Robotised View Camera</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10851-011-0306-y, http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0048, http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-011-0306-y, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-011-0306-y, https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0048, https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1102.html#abs-1102-0048, https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00561829/, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(53907aaa20f770854f5da246, null, null, null, null, null, null, Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, null, null, null, null, 1)</td><td>44</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b3c11c455f439fe45146</td><td>53e998a9b7602d97020df9bf</td><td>Requirements engineering is known to be a key factor for the success of\nsoftware projects.

One of the most frustrating aspects of research in the relative performance of these methods is that data where the final outcome is known is not available. In the US, a great deal of effort has been devoted to statistically recording detailed performance characteristics of major league professional baseball. Every year there has been two to four seasonal competitions, with known outcome in terms of the proportion of contests won. Successful teams often have diverse characteristics, emphasizing different characteristics. SMART, PROMETHEE, and a centroid method were applied to baseball data over the period 1901‚Äì1991. Baseball has undergone a series of changes in style over that period, and different physical and administrative characteristics. Therefore the data was divided into decades, with the first five years used as a training set, and the last five years used for data collection. Regression was used to develop the input for preference selection in each method. Single-attribute utilities for criteria performance were generated from the first five years of data from each set. Relative accuracy of multicriteria methods was compared over 114 competitive seasons for both selecting the winning team, as well as for rank-ordering all teams. All the methods have value in supporting human decision making. PROMETHEE II using Gaussian preference functions and SMART were found to be the most accurate.

In VCD, a vehicle opportunistically communicates with nearby access points (APs) to download the content of interest. To fully take advantage of such transient contact with APs, we proactively push content to the APs that the vehicles will likely visit in the near future. In this way, vehicles can enjoy the full wireless capacity instead of being bottle-necked by the Internet connectivity, which is either slow or even unavailable. We develop a new algorithm for predicting the APs that will soon be visited by the vehicles. We then develop a replication scheme that leverages the synergy among (i) Internet connectivity (which is persistent but has limited coverage and low bandwidth), (ii) local wireless connectivity (which has high bandwidth but transient duration), (iii) vehicular relay connectivity (which has high bandwidth but high delay), and (iv) mesh connectivity among APs (which has high bandwidth but low coverage).

The IBM embedded DRAM platform allows this seamless integration without compromising performance, reliability, or yield. We discuss the process architecture, the key parameters of the logic components used in the processor cores and other logic design blocks, the SRAM features used in the L2 cache, and the embedded DRAM that forms the L3 cache.

The measurement of white matter structure and features of the cortical surface can help define biomarkers that predict this risk. The measurement of these structures relies upon accurate automated segmentation routines, but these are often confounded by neonatal-specific imaging difficulties including poor contrast, low resolution, partial volume effects and the presence of significant natural and pathological anatomical variability. In this work we develop and evaluate an adaptive preterm multi-modal maximum a posteriori expectation-maximisation segmentation algorithm (AdaPT) incorporating an iterative relaxation strategy that adapts the tissue proportion priors toward the subject data. Also incorporated are intensity non-uniformity correction, a spatial homogeneity term in the form of a Markov random field and furthermore, the proposed method explicitly models the partial volume effect specifically mitigating the neonatal specific grey and white matter contrast inversion. Spatial priors are iteratively relaxed, enabling the segmentation of images with high anatomical disparity from a normal population. Experiments performed on a clinical cohort of 92 infants are validated against manual segmentation of normal and pathological cortical grey matter, cerebellum and ventricular volumes. Dice overlap scores increase significantly when compared to a widely-used maximum likelihood expectation maximisation algorithm for pathological cortical grey matter, cerebellum and ventricular volumes. Adaptive maximum a posteriori expectation maximisation is shown to be a useful tool for accurate and robust neonatal brain segmentation.</td><td>List(List(53f42669dabfaeb22f3c53ff, null, null, null, Manuel Jorge Cardoso, null, null, null, 0000-0003-1284-2558, Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK, null, null, List(Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK, The first two authors contributed equally to this work.), null, null), List(53f44c0fdabfaee2a1d4b8e8, null, a.melbourne@ucl.ac.uk, null, Andrew Melbourne, null, null, null, 0000-0001-7667-3947, Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK, null, null, List(Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK, Corresponding author., The first two authors contributed equally to this work.), null, null), List(53f3ac4ddabfae4b34aff2e4, null, null, null, Giles S.

While lying in an MR scanner 17 healthy participants (a) decided whether or not a given number triplet was presented in numerically ascending order, and (b) solved simple addition and subtraction problems. Standard general linear model analyses revealed a largely overlapping network in fronto-parietal regions for both tasks. By analyzing the spatial information over voxels using a whole-brain searchlight algorithm we identified a right hemispheric network comprising areas along the intraparietal sulcus and in the inferior frontal cortex which was similarly involved in order judgments and symbolic arithmetic.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the list of Web 2.0 services and their mashups that is provided on Programmableweb, a network of Web 2.0 services was constructed. Within this network a node represents a Web 2.0 service with an open API, and a link between two nodes represents the existence of a mashup service that uses the two nodes. Findings - The findings suggest that the evolution of the Web 2.0 service network; follows the preferential attachment rule although the exponent of the preferential attachment is lower than for other networks following a preferential attachment rule. Additionally the results indicate that the Web 2.0 service network evolves to a scale-free network but the exponent of the power law distribution is lower than for other networks. Originality/value - The research applied social network analysis to the Web 2.0 service network. It showed that its network structure and the evolution mechanism are different from those found in similar areas, e.g. the world wide web (WWW). The findings imply that there are factors which lower the exponent of the preferential attachment equation and the power law distribution of the degree centralities. Research limitation/implications - This paper did not investigate the factors responsible for the low values of the exponent of the preferential attachment equation and the exponent of the power law distribution. However, it is suggested that it could be correlated with the fact that the interconnection between nodes depends on the property of the nodes.</td><td>List(List(54088710dabfae450f424b6f, null, null, null, Junseok Hwang, null, null, null, null, Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea, null, null, List(Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea), null, null), List(540677d4dabfae44f0835781, null, null, null, J√∂rn Altmann, null, null, null, null, Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea, null, null, List(Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea), null, null), List(53f438a8dabfaeecd6974184, null, kibae36@snu.ac.kr, null, Kibae Kim, null, null, null, 0000-0002-4798-9114, Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea, null, null, List(Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea), null, null))</td><td>10.1108/14684520911010990</td><td>List(Network formation, Mashup, World Wide Web, Social network, Computer science, Social network analysis, Web 2.0, Web service, Preferential attachment, The Internet)</td><td></td><td>1468-4527</td><td>6.0</td><td>List(Worldwide web, Internet, Social networks, Computer communications software)</td><td>en</td><td>45</td><td>1057.0</td><td>1040.0</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a525b7602d9702e49a30, 53e9a711b7602d97030482c4, 53e9af40b7602d970397c5cb, 53e9a952b7602d97032a4cd1, 53e9bbe5b7602d97048387d0, 53e9b4d4b7602d9703ff7208, 53e9b010b7602d9703a689ee, 53e99b63b7602d9702409c11, 53e9ac82b7602d97036551c3, 53e9a082b7602d970296ce1b, 53e9abaab7602d9703554dbd)</td><td>The structural evolution of the Web 2.0 service network</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/14684520911010990, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(null, 1468-4527, null, null, null, 1468-4535, null, ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW, null, ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW, null, J, null)</td><td>33.0</td><td>2009</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2c01c455f439fe3e01f</td><td>53e998b8b7602d97020ee442</td><td></td><td>List(List(53f428d0dabfaeb22f3d1b61, null, null, 5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c9efa, Sebastian Haufe, null, null, null, null, dresden university of technology, null, 5f71b2c01c455f439fe3e01f, null, null, null), List(53f42e14dabfaee4dc722a68, null, null, 5b86c1e4e1cd8e14a39d0624, Michael Thielscher, null, null, null, null, university of new south wales, null, 5f71b28c1c455f439fe3c9bd, null, null, null))</td><td></td><td>List(Combinatorial game theory, Game mechanics, Computer science, Theoretical computer science, Simulations and games in economics education, General game playing, Artificial intelligence, Sequential game, Screening game, Epistemology, Answer set programming, Mathematical game)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(automated reasoning, answer set programming)</td><td>en</td><td>3</td><td></td><td></td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e998b8b7602d97020ee442_0.pdf</td><td>List(53e9aabdb7602d970343ac7f, 53e9a7a5b7602d97030e0d60, 53e9be4ab7602d9704b09fa0, 53e9a832b7602d970317989a, 53e9a26ab7602d9702b6f0ff, 53e9abdab7602d970358fec1, 53e9b49bb7602d9703fa7b55, 53e9b82fb7602d97043eb154, 53e99f5db7602d97028314fa, 53e9b6b0b7602d970423431f, 53e9b3efb7602d9703ede322, 5c78053d4895d9cbc6732758, 53e9afdab7602d9703a2ccce, 5c77961e4895d9cbc62a78d9, 56d8680edabfae2eeeb01bc6)</td><td>Automated Verification of Epistemic Properties for General Game Playing.</td><td>List(http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/KR/KR12/paper/view/4486)</td><td>List(555037777cea80f954188e5d, null, null, Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, null, null, null, KR, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2fa1c455f439fe3f934</td><td>53e998b0b7602d97020ee200</td><td>The geographical routing suffers from communication voids in wireless sensor networks WSNs. Thus, several void-handling techniques are proposed in the literature, but they are limited in case of critical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach handling both open and closed voids by using three complementary mechanisms. The first mechanism orients each packet that arrives on the network boundary toward the network middle by using the shortest path leading to the sink. The second mechanism is used by a node located on the boundary of a closed void to orient the received packets in optimal paths toward the sink. The third mechanism uses repellent forces generated by each closed void to repulse the packets from its boundary. To discharge the boundary nodes, our approach defines an announcement zone around each closed void and uses a two-hop forwarding mode in each boundary node. Our proposals achieved good performance.</td><td>List(List(53f43182dabfaedce54fa112, null, null, null, Mohamed Aissani, null, null, null, null, Computer Science Unit, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique EMP, P.O.

Recently researchers have proposed low-cost reliability solutions that detect hardware faults through software-level symptom monitoring. SWAT (SoftWare Anomaly Treatment), one such solution, demonstrated with microarchitecture-level simulations that symptom-based solutions can provide high fault coverage and a low Silent Data Corruption (SDC) rate. However, more accurate evaluations are needed to validate such solutions for hardware faults in real-world processor designs. In this paper, we evaluate SWAT's symptom-based detectors on gate-level faults using an FPGA-based, full-system prototype. With this platform, we performed a gate-level accurate fault injection campaign of 51,630 fault injections in the OpenSPARC T1 core logic across five SPECInt 2000 benchmarks. With an overall SDC rate of 0.79%, our results are comparable to previous microarchitecture-level evaluations of SWAT, demonstrating the effectiveness of symptom-based software detectors for permanent faults in real-world designs.</td><td>List(List(53f45532dabfaee0d9bef514, null, null, 5b86b6c3e1cd8e14a34cb721, A.

This paper describes how core networks will evolve to optical transport networks (OTNs), which are optimized for the transport of data traffic, resulting in an IP-directly-over-OTN paradigm. Special attention is paid to the survivability of such data-centric optical networks. This becomes increasingly crucial since more and more traffic is multiplexed onto a single fiber (e.g., 160√ó10 Gb/s), implying that a single cable cut can affect incredible large traffic volumes. In particular, this paper is tackling multilayer survivability problems, since a data-centric optical network consists of at least an IP and optical layer. In practice, this means that the questions \"in which layer or layers should survivability be provided?\" and \"if multiple layers are chosen for this purpose, then how should this functionality in these layers be coordinated?\" have to be answered. In addition to a theoretical study, some case studies are presented in order to illustrate the relevance of the described issues and to help in strategic planning decisions. Two case studies are studying the problem from a capacity viewpoint.

For example, the accumulated relative service time per user per month can be calculated given individual transaction data from which the user compliance with a service agreement can be determined and possibly billing can be processed. Nevertheless, due to user privacy concerns, cryptographic research developed transactions based on unlinkable anonymous credentials. Given the nature of anonymous credentials the ease of managing accumulated data (e.g., per user) is lost. To restore the possibility of management and accumulation of data it seems that a suitable form of privacy preserving data mining is needed. Indeed, privacy preserving data mining methods have been suggested for various protocols and interactions where individual data can be contributed in an encrypted form, but not within the context of anonymous credentials. Given our motivation we suggest a new notion of performing \"privacy preserving data mining within the context of anonymous cryptographic credential systems,\" so as to protect both the privacy of individually contributed data and the identity of their sources while revealing only what is needed. To instantiate our approach we focus on a primitive we call \"data mining group signatures\" (DMGS), where it is possible for a set of authorities to employ distributed quorum control for conducting privacy preserving data mining operations on a batch of transactions while preserving maximum possible anonymity. We define and model the new primitive and its security goals, we then present a construction and finally show its privacy and security properties. Along the way we build a methodology that safely combines multi-server protocols as sub-procedures in a more general setting.</td><td>List(List(53f4508cdabfaee4dc7fa52d, null, aggelos@cse.uconn.edu, 5b86b665e1cd8e14a34a34ad, Aggelos Kiayias, null, null, null, null, Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, USA, null, 5f71b2941c455f439fe3cd52, List(Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA), null, null), List(5489320cdabfaed7b5fa3a05, null, null, 5b86cc1ce1cd8e14a3e6a42f, Shouhuai Xu, null, null, null, null, University of Texas, San Antonio, USA, null, 5f71b2ca1c455f439fe3e48a, List(Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA), null, null), List(53f582fbdabfaeaad3f8045b, null, null, 5b86bd39e1cd8e14a37b7ae0, Moti Yung, null, null, null, null, Google Inc. and Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, null, 5f71b2d21c455f439fe3e823, List(Columbia Univ, Google Inc & Comp Sci, New York, NY USA), null, null))</td><td>10.1007/978-3-540-85855-3_5</td><td>List(Data mining, Internet privacy, Privacy by Design, Cryptography, Computer security, Computer science, Encryption, Group signature, Anonymity, Information privacy, Transaction data, Credential)</td><td></td><td>0302-9743</td><td></td><td>List(anonymous credential systems, data mining, user privacy concern, data mining operation, data mining method, anonymous credential, privacy preserving data mining, individual transaction data, data mining group signature, individual data, anonymous cryptographic credential system, transaction data, group signature, it security)</td><td>en</td><td>5</td><td>76</td><td>57</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9af6eb7602d97039ae06a, 53e99cdfb7602d9702591fb2, 53e9a91ab7602d970326da29, 599c7b32601a182cd2718313, 53e9a8e3b7602d970323102b, 53e99dbeb7602d970267cec4, 53e9a23eb7602d9702b44be3, 53e99924b7602d9702162950, 53e9b641b7602d970419f7c9, 53e99b36b7602d97023d6d1b, 53e9b9b4b7602d97045a874e, 53e9a67cb7602d9702fb11e6, 53e99d13b7602d97025c4f08, 53e9badfb7602d970470f3c8, 53e99b36b7602d97023d6d1b, 53e9be27b7602d9704ae124a, 53e9a098b7602d970297f23b, 599c7d32601a182cd280918d, 53e9984fb7602d9702081de3, 53e99818b7602d9702035f8f, 53e9980eb7602d9702021d85, 53e99b36b7602d97023d9353, 53e9981db7602d9702039a3b, 53e9b002b7602d9703a5bbb6, 53e9b7c0b7602d970436b303, 53e9a4b2b7602d9702dd201f, 53e9aa7ab7602d97033f2e78, 53e997fcb7602d97020095bd, 53e9ab00b7602d9703482ba1, 53e9a122b7602d9702a10813, 53e99b36b7602d97023d6d1b, 53e9af2db7602d970396aaa3)</td><td>Privacy Preserving Data Mining within Anonymous Credential Systems</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-85855-3_5, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(5550372b7cea80f954177a25, null, null, null, null, null, null, SCN, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>5229</td><td>2008</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2b11c455f439fe3d903</td><td>53e998c7b7602d9702100a60</td><td>It is well known that the Kraft inequality gives a necessary and sufficient condition on the codeword lengths of a zero-error instantaneous code for a single source.

Although the SIFT descriptor has been proven to perform better than the other existing local descriptors, it does not gain sufficient distinctiveness and robustness in image match especially in the case of affine and mirror transformations, in which many mismatches could occur. This paper presents an improvement to the SIFT descriptor for image matching and retrieval. The framework of the proposed descriptor consists of the following steps: normalizing elliptical neighboring region, transforming to affine scale-space, improving the SIFT descriptor with polar histogram orientation bin, as well as integrating the mirror reflection invariant. A comparative evaluation of different descriptors is carried out showing that the present approach provides better results than the existing methods.</td><td>List(List(53f46ec0dabfaee2a1dcfdb0, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9085, Kaiyang Liao, null, null, null, null, Xi'an Jiaotong University(Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an Jiaotong Univ,Xi'an Jiaotong Univ.),Xi An,China, null, 5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31, List(School of Electronic and Information EngineeringXi‚Äôan Jiaotong UniversityXi‚Äôan710049China), null, null), List(542a13d3dabfae646d537833, null, liugz@xjtu.edu.cn, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9085, Guizhong Liu, null, null, null, null, Xi'an Jiaotong University(Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an Jiaotong Univ,Xi'an Jiaotong Univ.),Xi An,China, null, 5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31, List(Corresponding author.

A decision procedure based on the proposed induced aggregation operator is developed for solving the multicriteria decision-making problem in which all the decision information is represented by intuitionistic fuzzy values. An illustrative example is given for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed decision procedure. ¬© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ¬© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</td><td>List(List(53f43835dabfaec09f18dedc, null, null, 5b86b246e1cd8e14a32c2903, Chunqiao Tan, null, null, null, null, School of Business, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China, null, 5f71b32e1c455f439fe410d4, List(), null, null), List(null, null, null, 5b86b246e1cd8e14a32c2903, Xiaohong Chen, null, null, null, null, School of Business, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China, null, 5f71b32e1c455f439fe410d4, List(), null, null))</td><td>10.1002/int.20489</td><td>List(Mathematical optimization, Multiple criteria, Fuzzy measure theory, Multicriteria decision, Intuitionistic fuzzy, Fuzzy set, Operator (computer programming), Choquet integral, Mathematics)</td><td></td><td></td><td>7</td><td>List(order-induced aggregation, induced intuitionistic fuzzy choquet, existing intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation, proposed induced aggregation operator, wiley periodicals, multicriteria decision, integral operator, fuzzy choquet integral operator, choquet aggregation, decision information, induced aggregation operator, generalized ifc integral operator, choquet integral)</td><td>en</td><td>46</td><td>686</td><td>659</td><td>null</td><td>List(573695916e3b12023e4b122e, 53e9a1e7b7602d9702ae5deb, 53e99e99b7602d9702760849, 53e99a98b7602d970230de69, 53e9aa81b7602d97033fbf8a, 53e9bc0ab7602d970486fd0c, 558b0338e4b031bae1fb041b, 53e9b94db7602d9704537ab3, 53e9ba84b7602d97046a6e15, 53e9bc53b7602d97048cba15, 53e9b8bab7602d970449612b, 53e9a6d0b7602d9703005e0d, 53e99809b7602d970201cb7e, 53e9bd1eb7602d97049a6c9d, 53e9b56cb7602d97040a66ea, 557d4157f667eeed56199e4a, 53e99d3db7602d97025f017e, 53e9985fb7602d9702098255, 53e9aab0b7602d970342f2bb, 53e999bbb7602d97022041f0, 53e99b7fb7602d9702427d07, 53e999eeb7602d97022351ae, 53e99a49b7602d97022aa985, 53e997fcb7602d97020066f6, 53e9a855b7602d97031a0368, 53e9b861b7602d97044276d6, 53e9b5ceb7602d9704117994, 53e9b41bb7602d9703f14a1d, 53e99fe4b7602d97028bf66f, 53e9a98eb7602d97032e8fe6, 53e997f8b7602d970200127d, 53e9bb80b7602d97047c8017, 53e99d12b7602d97025c432c, 53e9b86db7602d9704437b77, 5c77e9374895d9cbc663a13a, 53e99aa6b7602d97023212e0, 53e99d6cb7602d97026275bb, 558a89b9e4b037c08757ba96, 53e9a611b7602d9702f3e2e2, 53e99809b7602d970201d1a1)</td><td>Induced intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operator for multicriteria decision making</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/int.20489, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1002/int.20489)</td><td>List(555036e07cea80f95416278d, null, null, null, null, null, null, Int.

In this paper, we measure the photonic bandstructure in our sample and identify the lasing band edge. By mapping out the bandstructure at the Œì-point, we have observed fine structure at the band edge. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted bandstructure. Above threshold, we observe a lasing peak at 965 nm at one of the band edges. The far-field distribution of the laser is measured, showing an annular profile and azimuthal polarization. Calculations on the far-field distribution at the lasing band edge suggest the annular profile is due to an anti-symmetric resonant mode.</td><td>List(List(560209c445cedb3395efb2ef, Kyosuke Sakai (S'04) was born in Hokkaido, Japan, in 1977.

In particular, we focus on co-simulation, where an FMU either contains its own internal simulation algorithm or serves as a gateway to a simulation tool. We give conditions on the design of FMUs and master algorithms (which orchestrate the execution of FMUs) to achieve deterministic co-simulation. We show that with the current version of the standard, these conditions demand capabilities from FMUs that are optional in the standard and rarely provided by an FMU in practice. When FMUs lacking these required capabilities are used to compose a model, many basic modeling capabilities become unachievable, including simple discrete-event simulation and variable-step-size numerical integration algorithms. We propose a small extension to the standard and a policy for designing FMUs that enables deterministic execution for a much broader class of models. The extension enables a master algorithm to query an FMU for the time of events that are expected in the future. We show that a model can be executed deterministically if all FMUs in the model are either memoryless or implement one of rollback or step-size prediction. We show further that such a model can contain at most one \"legacy\" FMU that is not memoryless and provides neither rollback nor step-size prediction.</td><td>List(List(53f31966dabfae9a8442b54c, null, null, 5b86a889e1cd8e14a3eb23c3, David Broman, null, null, null, null, University of California, Berkeley and Link√∂ping University, Sweden, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6b7, null, null, null), List(53f43721dabfaee02acd065c, null, null, 5b86c411e1cd8e14a3ac7b62, Christopher Brooks, null, null, null, null, University of California, Berkeley, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6b7, null, null, null), List(53f43881dabfaedf43593539, null, null, 5b86c1b9e1cd8e14a39bce98, Lev Greenberg, null, null, null, null, IBM, null, 5f71b5c41c455f439fe532ea, null, null, null), List(53f642fcdabfaed5140f3cda, null, null, 5b86c411e1cd8e14a3ac7b62, Edward A.

In particular, each video file is analyzed in a multiscale structure of different \"content resolution levels\", creating a hierarchy from the lowest (coarse) to the highest (fine) resolution. The scheme resembles the progressive transmission of still images, where instead of transmitting the image sequentially at a full resolution, by scanning it line by line, a lower image resolution is first delivered and then, the image quality gradually enhances so that the user is able at any time to see a preview of the image content. The proposed video decomposition is represented as a graph structure, each level of which corresponds to a particular content resolution, while the graph-nodes the respective regions that the content is analyzed at this level. Transitions among nodes of the same level are also permitted. The number of nodes at a given level expresses the degree of detail that the content at this level is analyzed. This number is estimated by minimizing the average transmitted information, required for localizing a video segment of interest and also takes into account the content complexity.Quality criteria are introduced to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. The efficiency of the organization is maximized if multiscale content decomposition is performed using content representatives and constructing content classes. Content representatives are estimated in our approach as the ones of the maximum dissimilarity, expressed by a distance metric. The optimization is conducted by incorporating a stochastic algorithm of logarithmically reduced searching area (stochastic logarithmic). Experimental results on real-life video sequences show that the proposed multiscale video organization enables users to detect content of interest much faster, compared to the conventional sequential video scanning or other video decomposition/summarization methods, resulting in a better organization efficiency as measured by the quality criteria.</td><td>List(List(5489c2eadabfae8a11fb4771, null, ndoulam@cs.ntua.gr, null, Nikolaos Doulamis, null, null, null, null, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Computer Science Division, National Technical University of Athens, 11.23 office, 9, Heroon Polytechniou Street, Zografou 15773, Athens, Greece, null, 5f71b2d11c455f439fe3e77b, List(Correspondent author.

In this paper we study the network lifetime maximization problem and the delay time minimization problem together. To make both problems tractable, we have the assumption that each sensor node keeps working since it turns on. And we formulate the network lifetime maximization problem as maximizing the number of sensor nodes who don't turn on, and the delay time minimization problem as minimizing the routing path length, after achieving the required tracking tasks. Since we prove the problems are NP-complete and APX-complete , we propose three heuristic algorithms to solve them.

This achieves on-line knowledge acquisition, which is essential to the real-time incessant TCM onto-core evolutionary process. The MAT contents are stored in four related special data structures, which can be appended/disconnected to/from the skeletal TCM onto-core. As a result, the knowledge updates in the open evolvable onto-core affect only the MAT contents and do not alter any of the original skeletal onto-core information that was installed by consensus certification. The MAT contents are necessary for supporting the unique OCOE&CID semantic aliasing operation, which standardizes TCM knowledge with respect to the established enterprise vocabulary and discovers clinical intelligence.</td><td>List(List(53f46a35dabfaee43ed05d03, null, cshkwong@comp.polyu.edu.hk, null, Jackei H.

With the knowledge that the objective of a DDoS attack is to saturate as soon as possible the resources of the target, this would engender an unexpected disproportion between the number of received packets and the number of connections. However, in the case of flash crowds, an increase in the number of packets is always accompanied by an increase in the number of connections. In this work, we used joint-entropy that quantifies the degree of disproportion to detect traffic anomalies. We investigate a class of intelligent attacks, which, unlike high-rate attacks, are difficult for entropy schemes to detect. The experimental results indicate that our joint-entropy scheme can detect this type of attacks accurately. Compared with an entropy-based scheme, the improvement is 40% for the distributed attacks.

This is a difficult task for several reasons including the level of model detail, the technical aspects of experimental recordings and different experimental contexts. A recently developed method allows one to estimate synaptic background activities using subthreshold membrane potential distributions derived from intracellular recordings. This method requires the removal of spikes to obtain the estimates. We remove spikes from heterogeneous, inhibitory network model outputs (in which the underlying dynamics are understood) and obtain synaptic distributions from multiple simulations. We show that the distributions reflect the known model network characteristics and change appropriately with different parameter values. This suggests that model network characteristics can be constrained by the experimental data and direct links between the dynamics of model and biological networks can be made.</td><td>List(List(53f46bf1dabfaee4dc8644cb, null, fskinner@uhnres.utoronto.ca, 5b86bcabe1cd8e14a3774fda, F.

One proposed solution to this problem uses gossiping, a class of probabilistic routing protocol, to disseminate context information throughout the environment. Gossiping algorithms require far less in the way of guarantees about network structure, reliability, and latency than alternative approaches, but are unproven in real world scenarios.

User service expectations affect perceived service quality and user satisfaction. The objectives of this research are to i to explore the relationship between perceived IS service quality and user satisfaction across the three regions of zone of tolerance ZOT and ii to validate the associations between service expectations adequate service and desired service and service performance. The analysis of the data obtained from 193 IS users revealed a positive and significant association between perceived service quality and user satisfaction across the service zones and service dimensions with stronger associations in the acceptable service zone and weaker associations in the inadequate and superior service zones. Thus, the results demonstrate that the relationship between IS service quality and user satisfaction is affected by ZOT. It is found that the desired service expectation measure is more strongly related to service performance compared to the adequate service expectation measure. It is also observed that irrespective of the ZOT, the service dimension that contributes most to service performance is assurance. Tangibles have the widest ZOT and assurance has the narrowest ZOT compared to most other service dimensions.

Disassembly line is the most suitable setting to disassemble a product. Therefore, designing and balancing efficient disassembly systems are important to optimize the product recovery process. In this study, we deal with multi-objective optimization of a stochastic disassembly line balancing problem (DLBP) with station paralleling and propose a new genetic algorithm (GA) for solving this multi-objective optimization problem. The line balance and design costs objectives are simultaneously optimized by using an AND/OR Graph (AOG) of the product. The proposed GA is designed to generate Pareto-optimal solutions considering two different fitness evaluation approaches, repair algorithms and a diversification strategy. It is tested on 96 test problems that were generated using the benchmark problem generation scheme for problems defined on AOG as developed in literature.

An algorithm was developed to construct a statistical shape model (SSM) for the adult postmortem liver in autopsy imaging.First, we investigated the relationship between SSMs obtained from in vivo liver CT scans and those from postmortem cases. Liver shapes were embedded in level set functions and statistically modeled using a spatially weighted principal components analysis. The performance of the SSMs was evaluated in terms of generalization and specificity. Several algorithms for the transformation from in vivo livers to postmortem livers were proposed to enhance the performance of an SSM for a postmortem liver, followed by a comparative study on SSMs. Specifically, five SSMs for a postmortem liver were constructed and evaluated using 32 postmortem liver labels, and postmortem liver labels synthesized from 144 in vivo liver labels were constructed using the proposed transformation algorithms. We also compared the proposed SSMs with three conventional SSMs trained from postmortem liver labels and/or in vivo liver labels.The investigation showed that the performance of an SSM constructed using in vivo liver labels suffered when describing postmortem liver shapes. Two of the five proposed SSMs trained using synthesized postmortem livers showed the best performance with no significant differences between them, and they statistically outperformed all conventional SSMs tested.The performance of conventional SSMs can be improved by using both postmortem liver shape labels and artificial shape labels synthesized from in vivo liver shape labels.</td><td>List(List(543289e5dabfaeb54215b01a, null, 50013834203@st.tuat.ac.jp, null, Atsushi Saito, null, null, null, null, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,Koganei,Japan, null, 5f71b4041c455f439fe47001, null, null, null), List(56021c1445cedb3395f0eca6, null, null, null, Akinobu Shimizu, null, null, null, null, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,Koganei,Japan, null, 5f71b4041c455f439fe47001, null, null, null), List(53f42b46dabfaedd74d159a9, null, null, null, Hidefumi Watanabe, null, null, null, null, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,Koganei,Japan, null, 5f71b4041c455f439fe47001, null, null, null), List(53f42bd9dabfaedf434ff0d1, null, null, null, Seiji Yamamoto, null, null, null, null, Ai Information Center,Chuo-ku,Japan, null, null, null, null, null), List(5487802edabfaed7b5fa30b3, null, null, null, Shigeru Nawano, null, null, null, null, Department of Radiology,International University of Health and Welfare, Mita Hospital,Minato-ku,Japan, null, 5f71b44d1c455f439fe49077, null, null, null), List(5448dbacdabfae87b7e882a8, null, null, null, Hidefumi Kobatake, null, null, null, null, Institute of National Colleges of Technology,Hachioji,Japan, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/s11548-013-0923-6</td><td>List(Autopsy, Liver ct, Radiology, Medicine)</td><td></td><td>1861-6429</td><td>2</td><td>List(Statistical shape model,  Liver,  Autopsy imaging,  Synthesized-based learning,  Level set,  PCA)</td><td>en</td><td>0</td><td>281</td><td>269</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b91eb7602d97045079f0, 53e99ca8b7602d9702559b7b, 56d8e56adabfae2eee2e14fb, 53e9b077b7602d9703ade057, 53e9bb4bb7602d970478c2d1, 53e9b911b7602d97044f9002, 53e9bbdbb7602d9704829095, 5c7853a74895d9cbc691afc6, 53e9bcc1b7602d9704943398, 53e9987db7602d97020b5f51, 53e99d36b7602d97025e9093, 53e9b693b7602d9704205730, 53e9a3e7b7602d9702d00820, 53e9bd0ab7602d9704990902, 53e99e54b7602d970271b0aa, 55a5a99d612c6b12ab297194, 53e9bb52b7602d97047922d3, 53e9ad26b7602d9703706a5a, 573696176e3b12023e529eeb)</td><td>Statistical shape model of a liver for autopsy imaging.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11548-013-0923-6, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877279?report=xml&format=text, https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11548-013-0923-6)</td><td>List(555036c67cea80f954154646, null, null, null, null, null, null, Int.

A linear-bilinear cascade model approximation is proposed, and a control law is derived to force such an approximation to behave like the \"nearest\" linear system, A simple, easily implementable form is obtained.

HERO-2 was an international randomized trial of two antithrombotic therapies-unfractionated heparin and bivalirudin-for the treatment of AMI. This trial recruited 17073 patients from 46 countries from Europe, North and Latin America and Asia, including Australia, New Zealand and Russia. An important issue in applying findings from randomized clinical trials is the procedure to estimate risk among members of other patient populations. Methods for updating risk models for AMI are compared. Simple re-calibration (re-estimation of the intercept and slope of the linear predictor within regions) and model revision (re-estimation of all regression coefficients within regions) with and without shrinkage were compared to a global additive model with a built-in region effect. The relative performance of these methods in the different geographical regions, which vary in sample size, is of primary interest. Model revision only provided a slight improvement in predictive performance when applied with shrinkage in the smallest region Asia (N=756). In conclusion, a global model with regional re-calibration is adequate: region-specific coefficients did not provide worthwhile improvements in any region.</td><td>List(List(53f45684dabfaee1c0b2dfb4, null, rachel@ctc.usyd.edu.au, 5b86b6dfe1cd8e14a34d80ec, Rachel L.

The authors studied 300 spam messages collected over 15 weeks from a university email system. Messages were coded based on content, form and specific features as well as on the manifest relationship to existing genres of communication. The paper argues that spam is not a single genre but many genres. For the most part, the genres evoked in spam are adaptations of print to Internet, including information artifacts, pamphlets, business cards, order forms, bulletins, advertisements, and \"Nigerian letters\". With spam, however, the concept of genre operates at several levels. Often, there is a contradiction between the manifest genre and the underlying purposes. The paper concludes that spam exploits genre by conforming to known forms while at the same time breaching those norms.</td><td>List(List(53f431d0dabfaee0d9b3540d, null, null, 5b86b756e1cd8e14a350d044, Wendy L.

Instead, our approach is generic making it applicable for any pattern matching purpose and any conceptual modeling language. In order to build sets representing structural model patterns, we define operations based on set theory, which can be applied to arbitrary sets of model elements and relationships.

It corresponds to comparing, via fuzzy set inclusion, possibility distributions that are the most specific transforms of the original probability distributions. This partial ordering compares discrete probability distributions in terms of relative peakedness around their mode, and entropy is monotonic with respect to this partial ordering. In fact, all known variants of entropy share this monotonicity. In this paper, this question is studied in the case of unimodal continuous probability densities on the real line, for which a possibility transform around the mode exists. It corresponds to extracting the family of most precise prediction intervals. Comparing such prediction intervals for two densities yields a variant of relative peakedness in the sense of Birnbaum.

However, this method is not a suitable one for large datasets because of its quadratic time complexity with respect to the size of the dataset. This paper presents a simple prototype based hybrid approach to speed-up the kernel k-means clustering method for large datasets. The proposed method works in two stages. First, the dataset is partitioned into a number of small grouplets by using the leaders clustering method which takes the size of each grouplet, called the threshold t, as an input parameter. The conventional leaders clustering method is modified such that these grouplets are formed in the kernel induced feature space, but each grouplet is represented by a pattern (called its leader) in the input space. The dataset is re-indexed according to these grouplets. Later, the kernel k-means clustering method is applied over the set of leaders to derive a partition of the leaders set. Finally, each leader is replaced by its group to get a partition of the entire dataset. The time complexity as well as space complexity of the proposed method is O(n+p^2), where p is the number of leaders. The overall running time and the quality of the clustering result depends on the threshold t and the order in which the dataset is scanned. This paper presents a study on how the input parameter t affects the overall running time and the clustering quality obtained by the proposed method. Further, both theoretically and experimentally it has been shown how the order of scanning of the dataset affects the clustering result. The proposed method is also compared with the other recent methods that are proposed to speed-up the kernel k-means clustering method. Experimental study with several real world as well as synthetic datasets shows that, for an appropriate value of t, the proposed method can significantly reduce the computation time but with a small loss in clustering quality, particularly for large datasets.</td><td>List(List(53f31b4adabfae9a8443613b, null, t.hitendrasarma@gmail.com, 5b86a981e1cd8e14a3f17084, T.

Without a priori resource provisioning or reservation, this tends to have a serious effect on premium traffic from delay- and jitter-sensitive applications. This paper develops a new reservation-less mechanism for delay and jitter guarantees across \"single FIFO queue\" access links by controlling interfering non-premium traffic. The mechanism, called CONNET (CONtrolled NETwork), uses feedback regulation to create self-controlled network services capable of tracking delay and jitter references. We use a control-theoretic approach in designing the feedback loop based on a \"blackbox\" model of the access link in both cases of single and multiple nodes. For robust control, we employ optimal Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator. We evaluate the performance of CONNET using a real testbed implementation showing its superiority to other rate-based schemes (such as CBQ and WFQ) in terms of simplicity, deployability, and accuracy.</td><td>List(List(53f42bc1dabfaedd74d1e002, null, null, 5b86b6c3e1cd8e14a34cb721, Mohamed El Gendy, null, null, null, null, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c6a8, null, null, null), List(544892fadabfae87b7e46a07, null, null, 5b86b6c3e1cd8e14a34cb721, Kang G.

In this paper, we extend the BA problem over a combined wired/wireless network, consisting of both powerful computing stationary processor and low-power mobile processor.

Both binary classification and multicategory classification are investigated.

The tool permits to integrate the interaction between the system and the potential users when they create their melodies. One important contribution of this work is the proposal of specific musical genetic operators (different types of crossover, mutation and improvement operators) which ensure that the generated melodies are in concordance with Music Theory and they are also nice to listening. Moreover, our software tool can be customized to a particular musical style by including the specific musical knowledge domain in the system.

On the other hand, image-based key-frame representations for dense environment mapping have been developed. Both techniques have their relative advantages and disadvantages which will be analysed in this paper. In particular each representation's space-size requirements, their effective resolution, the computation efficiency, their accuracy and robustness will be compared.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of grouping the sensor nodes into clusters to enhance the overall scalability of the network. A selected set of nodes, known as gateway nodes, will act as cluster-heads for each cluster and the objective is to balance the load among these gateways. Load-Balanced Clustering increases system stability and improves the communication between the various nodes in the network. We call the problem addressed in this paper as the Load-Balanced Clustering Problem (LBCP). We first show that a special case of LBCP (whereby the traffic load contributed by all sensor nodes are the same) is optimally solvable in polynomial time. We next prove that the general case of LBCP is NP-hard. We then proposed an efficient 32-approximation algorithm for the problem.</td><td>List(List(53f430dcdabfaedf43542a39, null, icplow@ntu.edu.sg, 5b86b6cbe1cd8e14a34ce8a7, Chor Ping Low, null, null, null, null, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8a8, List(Corresponding author., School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore), null, null), List(53f43818dabfaee1c0aacf39, null, null, 5b86b6cbe1cd8e14a34ce8a7, Can Fang, null, null, null, null, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8a8, List(School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore), null, null), List(53f42fc9dabfaedf43534d9d, null, null, 5b86b6cbe1cd8e14a34ce8a7, Jim Mee Ng, null, null, null, null, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8a8, List(School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore), null, null), List(53f438fddabfaedf43598d18, null, null, 5b86b6cbe1cd8e14a34ce8a7, Yew Hock Ang, null, null, null, null, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8a8, List(School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore), null, null))</td><td>10.1016/j.comcom.2007.10.020</td><td>List(Leader election, Approximation algorithm, Key distribution in wireless sensor networks, Wireless network, Load balancing (computing), Computer science, Computer network, Artificial intelligence, Cluster analysis, Wireless sensor network, Scalability)</td><td></td><td>Computer Communications</td><td>4</td><td>List(Wireless sensor networks, Clustering, Load balancing, NP-hard approximation algorithm)</td><td>en</td><td>44</td><td>759</td><td>750</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b5a8b7602d97040ed47c, 53e99ee6b7602d97027b4348, 53e99d73b7602d970262b052, 53e9a839b7602d9703186120, 53e9a603b7602d9702f31e59, 5583d4b70cf2a1f3dc49c499, 53e99ee6b7602d97027af7af, 53e9b2c6b7602d9703d6da9e, 53e9b042b7602d9703aa11be)</td><td>Efficient Load-Balanced Clustering Algorithms for wireless sensor networks</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2007.10.020, http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2007.10.020, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366407004264)</td><td>List(539078f720f770854f5ab2fb, null, null, null, null, null, null, Computer Communications, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>31</td><td>2008</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2941c455f439fe3cd68</td><td>53e99915b7602d970214fcc8</td><td>The purpose of this study is to examine whether supportive interactions on social networking sites mediate the influence of SNS use and the number of SNS friends on perceived social support, affect, sense of community, and life satisfaction.

Under these conditions and in the presence of noise, the voxel intensity histogram is monomodal; therefore, segmenting the image with an intensity threshold is inaccurate. The present method, which is applicable to two-phase materials of discrete intensity, relies on iterative deconvolution to obtain a noiseless histogram. A noiseless image is then generated on the basis of the noiseless histogram and the unprocessed image. In the current work, the method is referred to as bone volume fraction (BVF) mapping, since it has been applied to determine the spatial distribution of trabecular bone. BVF computed from maps generated on the basis of in vivo magnetic resonance images of the human radius has been shown to compare well with bone mineral density (R 2 5 0.8). The accuracy and precision of BVF measurements have been further evaluated by using a BVF map of the radius as a gold standard and then adding different levels of noise to generate test images. The results suggest that the error in BVF is ,0.01 for SNR . 8. ¬© 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Exact analytic analysis of this kind of queues for the cases of infinite and finite input buffers is implemented.

The Markov chain embedded at service completion epochs at the first service stage and the process of system states at arbitrary time are investigated.

Interestingly, detection can take much longer than recovery, as a result of many advances in recovery techniques, making failure detection the dominant factor in these systems' unavailability when a crash occurs. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Falcon, a failure detector with several features. First, Falcon's common-case detection time is sub-second, which keeps unavailability low. Second, Falcon is reliable: it never reports a process as down when it is actually up. Third, Falcon sometimes kills to achieve reliable detection but aims to kill the smallest needed component. Falcon achieves these features by coordinating a network of spies, each monitoring a layer of the system. Falcon's main cost is a small amount of platform-specific logic. Falcon is thus the first failure detector that is fast, reliable, and viable. As such, it could change the way that a class of distributed systems is built.</td><td>List(List(53f4351cdabfaec09f171e21, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9598, Joshua B.

These examples constitute one\n of the main challenges to the received view on the foundations of decision theory offered by Leonard Savage in Savage (1972).\n Craig Fox and Amos Tversky have, nevertheless, offered an indirect defense of Savage. They provided in Fox and Tversky (1995)\n an explanation of Ellsberg‚Äôs two-color problem in terms of a psychological effect: ambiguity aversion. The ‚Äòcomparative ignorance‚Äô hypothesis articulates how this effect works and explains why it is important to an understanding\n of the typical pattern of responses associated with Ellsberg‚Äôs two-color problem. In the first part of this article we challenge\n Fox and Tversky‚Äôs explanation. We present first an experiment that extends Ellsberg‚Äôs two-color problem where certain predictions\n of the comparative ignorance hypothesis are not confirmed. In addition the hypothesis seems unable to explain how the subjects\n resolve trade-offs between security and expected pay-off when vagueness is present. Ellsberg offered an explanation of the\n typical behavior elicited by his examples in terms of these trade-offs and in section three we offer a model of Ellsberg‚Äôs\n trade-offs. The model takes seriously the role of imprecise probabilities in explaining Ellsberg‚Äôs phenomenon. The so-called\n three-color problem was also considered in Fox and Tversky (1995). We argue that Fox and Tversky‚Äôs analysis of this case breaks\n a symmetry with their analysis of the two-color problem. We propose a unified treatment of both problems and we present a\n experiment that confirms our hypothesis.</td><td>List(List(53f46a8adabfaee1c0b77f6b, null, hcosta@andrew.cmu.edu, 5b869b5be1cd8e14a39454c5, Horacio L.

In addition to genuine biological co-expression, correlated signals can result from technical deficiencies like hybridization of reporters with off-target transcripts. An approach that is able to distinguish these factors permits the detection of more biologically relevant co-expression signatures.We demonstrate a positive relation between off-target reporter alignment strength and expression correlation in data from oligonucleotide genechips. Furthermore, we describe a method that allows the identification, from their expression data, of individual probe sets affected by off-target hybridization.The effects of off-target hybridization on expression correlation coefficients can be substantial, and can be alleviated by more accurate mapping between microarray reporters and the target transcriptome.

Most of previous works have been focused only on visual information (i.e., image signal), thus missing an important source of information present in human interactions: the audio. So far, such approaches have not shown to be discriminative enough. This work proposes the use of Audio-Visual Bag of Words (AVBOW) as a more powerful mechanism to approach the HIR problem than the traditional Visual Bag of Words (VBOW). We show in this paper that the combined use of video and audio information yields to better classification results than video alone. Our approach has been validated in the challenging TVHID dataset showing that the proposed AVBOW provides statistically significant improvements over the VBOW employed in the related literature.</td><td>List(List(53f44246dabfaee2a1d2680a, null, mjmarin@uco.es, 5b869dcae1cd8e14a3a501bf, M.

In practice, non-Euclidean or non-metric dissimilarity measures may arise when contours, spectra or shapes are compared by edit distances or as a consequence of robust object matching [1,2]. It is an open issue whether such measures are advantageous for statistical learning or whether they should be constrained to obey the metric axioms. The k-nearest neighbor (NN) rule is widely applied to general dissimilarity data as the most natural approach. Alternative methods exist that embed such data into suitable representation spaces in which statistical classifiers are constructed [3]. In this paper, we investigate the relation between non-Euclidean aspects of dissimilarity data and the classification performance of the direct NN rule and some classifiers trained in representation spaces. This is evaluated on a parameterized family of edit distances, in which parameter values control the strength of non-Euclidean behavior. Our finding is that the discriminative power of this measure increases with increasing non-Euclidean and non-metric aspects until a certain optimum is reached. The conclusion is that statistical classifiers perform well and the optimal values of the parameters characterize a non-Euclidean and somewhat non-metric measure.</td><td>List(List(53f44a0fdabfaee02ad27d3d, null, e.m.pekalska@tudelft.nl, 5b86a70ae1cd8e14a3e14517, El≈ºbieta Pƒôkalska, null, null, null, null, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, null, 5f71b28a1c455f439fe3c93b, null, null, null), List(53f435cadabfaeb2ac04e5f6, null, null, 5b86a70ae1cd8e14a3e14517, Artsiom Harol, null, null, null, null, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, null, 5f71b28a1c455f439fe3c93b, null, null, null), List(53f4e081dabfaefae477b3ba, null, null, 5b86a70ae1cd8e14a3e14517, Robert P.

CTDL is a randomized learning technique which interweaves two search processes that operate in the intra-game and inter-game mode. Intra-game learning is driven by gradient-descent Temporal Difference Learning (TDL), a reinforcement learning method that updates the board evaluation function according to differences observed between its values for consecutively visited game states. For the inter-game learning component, we provide a coevolutionary algorithm that maintains a sample of strategies and uses the outcomes of games played between them to iteratively modify the probability distribution, according to which new strategies are generated and added to the sample. We analyze CTDL's sensitivity to all important parameters, including the trace decay constant that controls the lookahead horizon of TDL, and the relative intensity of intra-game and inter-game learning. We also investigate how the presence of memory (an archive) affects the search performance, and find out that the archived approach is superior to other techniques considered here and produces strategies that outperform a handcrafted weighted piece counter strategy and simple liberty-based heuristics. This encouraging result can be potentially generalized not only to other strategy representations used for small-board Go, but also to various games and a broader class of problems, because CTDL is generic and does not rely on any problem-specific knowledge.</td><td>List(List(54334d31dabfaeb542184ece, null, null, 5b86cd8de1cd8e14a3f14b81, Krzysztof Krawiec, null, null, null, null, Institute of Computing Science, Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology, ul.

The new convergence criteria are weaker than the older convergence criteria. Furthermore, in the local convergence case, we obtain a larger radius of convergence and tighter error estimates on the distances involved.

We show that the linear pool can be justified in an analogous but technically different way to linear pools for probability assessments, and that this linear pool has a very convenient property: a linear pool of experts‚Äô assessments of moments is coherent if each of the experts has given coherent assessments. To determine the weights of the linear pool we give a method of performance based weighting analogous to Cooke's classical model and explore its properties. Finally, we compare its performance with the classical model on data gathered in applications of the classical model.</td><td>List(List(53f43ec4dabfaee43ec69e28, null, bram.wisse@strath.ac.uk, null, Bram Wisse, null, null, null, null, Department of Management Science, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK, null, null, List(Department of Management Science, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK, TNO Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, The Netherlands, Corresponding author.), null, null), List(53f461cfdabfaee02ad81ef6, null, tim.bedford@strath.ac.uk, 5b86a6e1e1cd8e14a3e02d95, Tim Bedford, null, 544bda1245ce266baf65105b, null, null, Department of Management Science, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK, null, 5f71b2931c455f439fe3ccd2, List(Department of Management Science, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK), null, null), List(56022eef45cedb3395f2c66d, null, j.quigley@strath.ac.uk, 5b86a6e1e1cd8e14a3e02d95, John Quigley, null, 544bda1245ce266baf65105b, null, null, Department of Management Science, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK, null, 5f71b2931c455f439fe3ccd2, List(Department of Management Science, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK), null, null))</td><td>10.1016/j.ress.2007.03.003</td><td>List(Decision analysis, Scoring rule, Data modeling, Data mining, Weighting, System safety, Probability distribution, Decision model, Mathematics, Bayes' theorem)</td><td>null</td><td>0951-8320</td><td>5</td><td>List(Expert judgement, Combination, Scoring rule, Performance based weighting, Moment methods, Bayes linear)</td><td>en</td><td>12</td><td>686</td><td>675</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a0c9b7602d97029b052b, 53e99d65b7602d970261d28b)</td><td>Expert judgement combination using moment methods</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2007.03.003, http://www.webofknowledge.com/, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832007000956)</td><td>List(null, 0951-8320, null, null, null, null, Elsevier, Reliability Engineering & System Safety, null, reliability-engineering-and-system-safety, null, J, null)</td><td>93</td><td>2008</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2811c455f439fe3c57c</td><td>53e9992bb7602d9702169055</td><td>This note deals with the constant control problem for homogeneous cooperative and irreducible systems. These systems serve as models for positive systems. A necessary and sufficient condition for global asymptotic stability of the zero solution of this class of systems is known. Adding a constant control allows to shift the equilibrium point from zero to a point in the first orthant. We prove that for every nontrivial nonnegative control vector a unique nontrivial equilibrium point is achieved which is globally asymptotically stable if the zero solution of the uncontrolled system is globally asymptotically stable. In addition a converse result is provided. Finally a stability result for a particular class of Kolmogorov systems is established.

While low to intermediate doses of caffeine are associated with positive feelings and increased mental performance and alertness, high doses induce negative feelings such as insomnia, anxiety and nervousness. We investigate if this nonlinear dose‚Äìresponse is present for caffeine's effects on functional activation. Twenty-seven healthy subjects were assigned randomly to four different groups: saline, 1¬†mg/kg, 2.5¬†mg/kg and 5¬†mg/kg doses of caffeine. Simultaneous ASL/BOLD timeseries were collected both before and after an intravenous infusion of saline or caffeine and the task-induced CBF and BOLD percent changes were compared. The maximum increase in BOLD response was associated with the intermediate caffeine dose of 2.5¬†mg/kg, which increased BOLD response by 32.2% and 32.5% in motor and visual areas respectively. The maximum increase in CBF response was associated with the highest caffeine dose of 5¬†mg/kg.

One of the approaches is anonymization approach that is able to protect private information; however, valuable information can be lost.

In this research, we focused on the switching problem of FES, which is one of the obstacles that prevent FES from further practical uses. An adaptive switching for FES control for the lower limbs‚Äô activities of hemiplegic patients was developed, based on the consideration that, lower limbs‚Äô activities need the synchronization of limbs of both sides. Electromyogram (EMG) signals detected from normal side of hemiplegic patients were used to recognize the activities that the patients intend to do. The recognition results were utilized as the switching signals. However, motion patterns represented and analyzed by EMG are distinctive of individual variations and characteristic alternation, which inevitably result in classification errors in EMG analyzing. To overcome these problems, a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) was embedded in an on-line process to form an analyzing system that can adapt to individual characteristics and trace the nonstationary factor. Furthermore, in order to enable the analyzing system to recognize right timings from the EMG-described dynamical processes of activities, such as standing-up and walking, a practical training-set construction method that utilizes additional reference data was proposed. The proposed switching system was applied to a FES system that supports standing-up and walking for a hemiplegics subject, to verify the effectiveness.</td><td>List(List(5602315e45cedb3395f3177c, null, yu@complex.eng.hokudai.ac.jp, null, Wenwei Yu, null, null, null, null, Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan, null, null, List(Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan, Corresponding author.), null, null), List(5602315e45cedb3395f3177f, null, null, 5b86b150e1cd8e14a3253f43, Hiroshi Yamaguchi, null, null, null, null, Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan, null, 5f71b29d1c455f439fe3d17c, List(Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan), null, null), List(563046b445cedb33999c15fa, null, null, 5b86b150e1cd8e14a3253f43, Hiroshi Yokoi, null, null, null, null, Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan, null, 5f71b29d1c455f439fe3d17c, List(Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan), null, null), List(53f4374adabfaee2a1cee583, null, null, null, Masaharu Maruishi, null, null, null, null, Department of Rehabilitation, Hiroshima Rehabilitation Center, Hiroshima, Japan, null, null, List(Department of Rehabilitation, Hiroshima Rehabilitation Center, Hiroshima, Japan), null, null), List(53f43aa3dabfaee02acf3684, null, null, 5b86b150e1cd8e14a3253f43, Yukio Mano, null, null, null, null, Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan, null, 5f71b29d1c455f439fe3d17c, List(Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan), null, null), List(54480bd5dabfae87b7dcac07, null, null, 5b86b150e1cd8e14a3253f43, Yukinori Kakazu, null, null, null, null, Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan, null, 5f71b29d1c455f439fe3d17c, List(Laboratory of Autonomous Systems Engineering, Division of System and Information Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan), null, null))</td><td>10.1016/S0921-8890(02)00246-4</td><td>List(Reference data (financial markets), Functional electrical stimulation, Adaptive switching, Synchronization, Simulation, Computer science, Control engineering, Artificial neural network, Construction method, Normal side, Alternation (linguistics))</td><td></td><td>0921-8890</td><td>2</td><td>List(Functional Electrical Stimulation, EMG, Artificial neural network, Machine learning, Human‚Äìmachine interface)</td><td>en</td><td>32</td><td>224</td><td>213</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>EMG automatic switch for FES control for hemiplegics using artificial neural network</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8890(02)00246-4, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889002002464, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(null, 0921-8890, null, null, null, null, North-Holland, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, null, robotics-and-autonomous-systems, null, J, null)</td><td>40</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2961c455f439fe3ce4d</td><td>53e99938b7602d97021790f9</td><td>In this paper, we present an efficient query-by-singing based musical retrieval system.

Experiments show that the 3rd coefficient is the most relevant to music comparison out of 13 coefficients and the proposed simplified MFCC feature is able to achieve a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To improve system efficiency, we re-organize the database by a new two-stage clustering scheme in both time space and feature space. We combine K-means algorithm and dynamic time wrapping similarity measurement for feature space clustering. We also propose a new method for model-selection of K-means algorithm.

It is important that a mechanism of quantification he utilized for determining pricing. Also in these environments, we believe that price needs to be adapted to reflect and influence dynamic change in demand on resources, and can be used, as an economic mechanism, to efficiently manage a utility computing environment. To achieve this, we propose in this paper an adaptive pricing mechanism. The objective of this scheme is twofold: it, for business objectives, adapts price based upon the supply and demand curves over time intervals; on the other hand, price invisibly manages the distribution of resource demand across time intervals, therefore makes resource utilization more efficient and balanced over time. In this approach, the resource unit to be priced is called capacity unit, and applications are billed based upon the capacity units that have been reserved or used.</td><td>List(List(53f436a5dabfaeb1a7bf5fd7, null, null, null, Jinsong Ouyang, null, null, null, null, California State University-Sacramento******, null, 5f71b2b61c455f439fe3db7a, List(California State University-Sacramento******), null, null), List(54861253dabfae8a11fb2f79, null, null, null, Akhil Sahai, null, null, null, null, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Rd., Palo Alto, CA, USA, Akhil.Sahai@hp.com, null, 5f71b47f1c455f439fe4a655, List(Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Rd., Palo Alto, CA, USA, Akhil.Sahai@hp.com), null, null), List(53f42d15dabfaedf435126b9, null, null, null, Jim Pruyne, null, null, null, null, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Rd., Palo Alto, CA, USA, Jim.Pruyne@hp.com, null, 5f71b47f1c455f439fe4a655, List(Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Rd., Palo Alto, CA, USA, Jim.Pruyne@hp.com), null, null))</td><td>10.1109/BDIM.2007.375010</td><td>List(Resource management, Microeconomics, Operations research, Utility computing, Resource allocation, Memory management, Shared resource, Supply and demand, Resource utilization, Multiple time dimensions, Business)</td><td>1-4244-1295-1</td><td></td><td></td><td>List(multiple users, on-demand services, utility computing environment, resource utilization, shared resource pool, adaptive pricing mechanism, resource metering, resource allocation, resource reservation, demand and supply, capacity unit, utility services providers, adaptive pricing, utility computing, pricing, environmental management, resource management, environmental economics, computational modeling, computer vision, service provider, supply and demand, computer science, memory management)</td><td>en</td><td>3</td><td>44</td><td>39</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b54ab7602d97040838c8, 53e9b4e9b7602d9704012445, 53e9b7b4b7602d970435c58f, 53e99976b7602d97021b9b08, 53e9a7b3b7602d97030eeff3, 53e9b96fb7602d970456049c, 53e9ab2bb7602d97034b5a47, 557ce43c6feeaa8086da33c9, 53e9b500b7602d970402e506)</td><td>A Mechanism of Specifying and Determining Pricing in Utility Computing Environments</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BDIM.2007.375010, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261099, http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/bdim/bdim2007.html#OuyangSP07, http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000004261099, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4261099)</td><td>List(53a72d5920f7420be8c62951, null, null, null, null, null, null, BDIM, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2007</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31</td><td>53e9993fb7602d970217b1bb</td><td>Lines restoration is a specific research issue needed attentions in the image restoration and representation field.

Four traditionally used feature-extraction methods were considered: principal component analysis, independent component analysis, auto-regression, and wavelets. We add to these a less well-known method called interval feature extraction. It overproduces features from the ERP signal and then eliminates irrelevant and redundant features by the fast correlation-based filter. To make the comparisons fair, the other feature-extraction methods were also run with the filter. An experiment on two EEG datasets (four classification scenarios) was carried out to examine the classification accuracy of four classifiers on the extracted features: support vector machines with linear and perceptron kernel, the nearest neighbour classifier and the random forest ensemble method. The interval features led to the best classification accuracy in most of the configurations, specifically when used with the Random Forest classifier ensemble.</td><td>List(List(54092beedabfae92b425f544, null, null, null, Ludmila I.

Therefore, we propose an architecture to discover the key users in a virtual community. By applying the architecture, it would be a very efficient and low cost approach.

The intent is to heuristically identify \"interesting\" rules more efficiently, from less data. This challenge is similar to that of identifying \"high-value\" attributes within the more general framework of machine learning, where early identification of key attributes can profoundly influence the learning outcome. In developing heuristics for improving the focus of association rule mining, there is also the question of where in the overall process such heuristics are applied. For example, many such focusing methods have been applied after the generation of a large number of rules, providing a kind of ranking or filtering. An alternative is to constrain the input data earlier in the data mining process, in an attempt to deploy heuristics in advance, and hope that early resource savings provide similar or even better mining results. In this paper we consider possible improvements to the problem of achieving focus in web mining, by investigating both the articulation and deployment of rule constraints to help attain analysis convergence and reduce computational resource requirements.</td><td>List(List(53f42ce2dabfaee2a1c745ba, null, mohammad@cs.ualberta.ca, 5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c9ecb, Mohammad El-Hajj, null, null, null, null, University of Alberta, Canada, null, 5f71b2941c455f439fe3cd7c, List(Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada), null, null), List(53f46ebddabfaee1c0b87b85, null, null, 5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c9ecb, Jiyang Chen, null, null, null, null, University of Alberta, Canada, null, 5f71b2941c455f439fe3cd7c, List(Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada), null, null), List(53f4a0d0dabfaedd74eb71a6, null, null, 5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c9ecb, Osmar R.

We show that this distribution, and the best estimate based upon it, namely the maximum-likelihood estimate, together constitute a saddle point. The MMDL approach results in a thresholding scheme that is resistant to heavy tailed noise. We further extend this framework and propose a novel approach to selecting an adapted or best basis (BB) that results in optimal signal reconstruction.

Here, deception refers to a preemptive and intelligent use of concealed interdiction assets and decoys by the defender, in addition to transparent assets commonly employed in modeling defender-attacker problems. These models can help security planners to locate a limited number of checkpoints and sensors of various types to, for example, detect the smuggling of illegal products. The problem is complex, in part, because the objective functions of the defender and the attacker are different, and because the latter (which represents the attacker's behavior) is difficult to predict by the defender. First, we use duality theory and a generalized network flow model to devise an equivalent mixed-integer programming formulation, and develop its Benders decomposition. We extend this formulation with a multiobjective approach to account for several behaviors simultaneously. The computational effort to solve these models is considerable, as exemplified by our testing on a variety of cases for a medium-sized, notional network. Published 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abnormal trajectories are detected as samples with low likelihoods. The semantic regions, which are intersections of paths commonly taken by objects, related to activities in the scene are also modeled. Dual-HDP advances the existing hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP) language model. HDP only clusters co-occurring words from documents into topics and automatically decides the number of topics. Dual-HDP co-clusters both words and documents. It learns both the numbers of word topics and document clusters from data. Under our problem settings, HDP only clusters observations of objects, while Dual-HDP clusters both observations and trajectories.

This hierarchical structure is a result of cognitive evolution. Therefore, the ordering of the individual modules will follow the general rules of phylogeny. In particular, the complexity of spatial tasks to be solved by an organism and the behaviours evolved as adaptation to these tasks is of great relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to spatial hierarchy based on the complexity of the tasks, rather than on the complexity of the underlying mechanisms. Individual levels of the task hierachy are discussed from a theoretical point of view and specific experimental examples are given. In conclusion, hierachies based on tasks seem to differ from representational hierarchies in three respects, the treatment of landmarks, the role of metric information, and the relation of language and space.</td><td>List(List(53f4411ddabfaee4dc7c0df0, null, null, null, Sabine Gillner, null, null, null, null, Univ Tubingen, Dept Zool, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany, null, null, List(Univ Tubingen, Dept Zool, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany), null, null), List(53f45367dabfaeee22a29202, null, null, null, Hanspeter A.

It is shown that as long as pri- vacy loss (or more accurately a measure related to privacy loss) is below a limit, through the use of properly coded credentials, it is possible to achieve arbitrarily good trust.

The original parallel MPI version of the QMC code was,developed,by the Electronic Structure of Solids HPCI consortium,in collaboration with EPCC. This code has been highly successful, and has resulted in numerous publications based on results generated,on the National Cray MPP systems,at EPCC. Recent interest has focussed,on also utilising shared-memory,parallelism in the code since future HPC systems,are expected,to comprise,clusters of SMP nodes. The code,has been,re-written to allow for an arbitrary mix,of OpenMP and MPI parallelism. The various,issues which,arose during,the parallelisation are discussed. The performance,of the mixed,OpenMP/MPI code has been assessed on an SGI Origin 2000 system,and,the results compared,and,contrasted to the original MPI version.

The function to be computed is f G (x 1 ,...,x n ) : = x 1 ¬∑...¬∑x n where each participant P i holds an input x i from the non-commutative group G . The settings of their study are the passive adversary model, information-theoretic security and black-box group operations over G . They presented three results. The first one is that honest majority is needed to ensure security when computing f G . Second, when the number of adversary $t\\leq\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil-1$, they reduced building such a secure protocol to a graph coloring problem and they showed that there exists a deterministic secure protocol computing f G using exponential communication complexity. Finally, Desmedt et al. turned to analyze random coloring of a graph to show the existence of a probabilistic protocol with polynomial complexity when t n /Œº , in which Œº is a constant less than 2.948. We call their analysis method of random coloring the counting method as it is based on the counting of the number of a specific type of random walks. This method is inspiring because, as far as we know, it is the first instance in which the theory of self-avoiding walk appears in multiparty computation. In this paper, we first give an altered exposition of their proof.

A new interpretation of union and intersection types allows statically gathering the type information of dynamic references, which improves runtime performance and robustness.

Every expert has his own formalisms and tools leading to a high heterogeneity of information systems supporting design activities. Interoperability became a major challenge to avoid information incompatibility along the product life cycle. To synchronise heterogeneous representations of product will be a major step to integrate expert activities. In this paper, the authors propose a meta-model framework to connect together heterogeneous design models. This meta-model framework is used to formalise possible interactions between heterogeneous representations. Interaction formalisation is considered as a key point to synchronise heterogeneous models and to provide more interoperability between various computer assisted systems. The synchronisation loop is also presented as a major sequence of activities to manage collaborative design. Tools to support synchronisation are proposed.

Usage of deallocation hints is similar to trusted manual deallocation, but the consequence of an inaccurate hint is lost performance not correctness. Our hinted collector algorithm uses these hints to identify a subset of unreachable objects with both better parallel asymptotic complexity and practical performance. On some benchmarks, our prototype collector implementation achieves 10-20% pause time reductions.

We verified through instruction level profiling that when these schemes are combined with various H.264/AVC coding techniques, the computational burden to derive the motion data could be considerably aggravated. Specifically, its computational complexity amounts to maximally 55% of that of the overall syntax parsing process. In this paper, we aim at an efficient hardware design of the motion data decoding process for H.264/AVC, for which all the key design considerations are addressed in detail and respective rational answers are presented. As comparing the resulting hardware design with the processor-based solution, its effectiveness was clearly demonstrated. The proposed design was implemented with 43.2K logic gates and three on-chip memories of 3584 bits using Samsung Semiconductor's Standard Cell Library in 65nm L6LP process technology (SS65LP), and was capable of operating the H.264/AVC high-profile video bitstream of 1080p@60fps at 100MHz consuming 843@mW.</td><td>List(List(53f438e9dabfaee2a1cfeb5d, null, null, 5b869f75e1cd8e14a3b0ebe7, Kiwon Yoo, null, null, null, null, School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea, null, 5f71b2c41c455f439fe3e1bb, List(Yonsei Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea), null, null), List(53f43225dabfaee1c0a714de, null, khsohn@yonsei.ac.kr, 5b869f75e1cd8e14a3b0ebe7, Kwanghoon Sohn, null, null, null, null, School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea, null, 5f71b2c41c455f439fe3e1bb, List(Yonsei Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea), null, null))</td><td>10.1016/j.image.2009.12.001</td><td>List(Quarter-pixel motion, Computer science, Context-adaptive variable-length coding, Direct mode, Standard cell, Decoding methods, Motion estimation, Computer hardware, Very-large-scale integration, Scalable Video Coding)</td><td></td><td>Signal Processing: Image Communication</td><td>3</td><td>List(efficient hardware design, motion data, avc coding technique, l6lp process technology, key design consideration, computational burden, resulting hardware design, various h.264, avc high-profile video bitstream, proposed design, computational complexity, vlsi design, logic gate, chip)</td><td>en</td><td>1</td><td>223</td><td>208</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9bbe0b7602d9704834561, 53e9a8b7b7602d9703202f0d, 53e99cc2b7602d970257a46a, 53e99cedb7602d97025a2355, 53e99de8b7602d97026a76ee, 53e9adb6b7602d97037bad4d, 53e9a72eb7602d97030683bf)</td><td>Hardware design of motion data decoding process for H.264/AVC</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2009.12.001, http://www.webofknowledge.com/, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923596509001362)</td><td>List(555036c07cea80f954151691, null, null, null, null, null, null, Sig.

Its value depends on the proportion pi(0) of non-differentially expressed (non-DE) genes. In most microarray studies, many genes have small effects not easily separable from non-DE genes. As a result, current methods often overestimate pi(0) and FDR, leading to unnecessary loss of power in the overall analysis.For the common two-sample comparison we derive a natural mixture model of the test statistic and an explicit bias formula in the standard estimation of pi(0). We suggest an improved estimation of pi(0) based on the mixture model and describe a practical likelihood-based procedure for this purpose.The analysis shows that a large bias occurs when pi(0) is far from 1 and when the non-centrality parameters of the distribution of the test statistic are near zero. The theoretical result also explains substantial discrepancies between non-parametric and model-based estimates of pi(0). Simulation studies indicate mixture-model estimates are less biased than standard estimates. The method is applied to breast cancer and lymphoma data examples.An R-package OCplus containing functions to compute pi(0) based on the mixture model, the resulting FDR and other operating characteristics of microarray data, is freely available at http://www.meb.ki.se/~yudpawyudi.pawitan@meb.ki.se and alexander.ploner@meb.ki.se.</td><td>List(List(53f45372dabfaee02ad4d9c6, null, yudi.pawitan@meb.ki.se, null, Yudi Pawitan, null, null, null, null, Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet  17177 Stockholm, Sweden, null, 5f71b2921c455f439fe3cc7d, List(), null, null), List(53f4611cdabfaee4dc838a9c, null, null, 5b8690a9e1cd8e14a34d7eeb, Karuturi R Krishna Murthy, null, null, null, null, Genome Institute of Singapore  Singapore, null, null, List(), null, null), List(53f434bedabfaedd74d91580, null, null, 5b868b2ee1cd8e14a32a97ca, Stefan Michiels, null, null, null, 0000-0002-6963-2968, Unit of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Institute Gustave Roussy  Villejuif, France, null, 5f71b5211c455f439fe4eff7, List(), null, null), List(53f4627ddabfaedf4363675d, null, null, null, Alexander Ploner, null, null, null, 0000-0002-5042-8326, Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet  17177 Stockholm, Sweden, null, 5f71b2921c455f439fe3cc7d, List(), null, null))</td><td>10.1093/bioinformatics/bti626</td><td>List(Data mining, False discovery rate, Microarray, Test statistic, Microarray analysis techniques, Statistics, Mathematics, Mixture model)</td><td></td><td>1367-4803</td><td>20</td><td>List(false discovery rate, microarray study, improved estimation, microarray data, non-de gene, large bias, test statistic, explicit bias formula, natural mixture model, lymphoma data example, mixture model, breast cancer)</td><td>en</td><td>80</td><td>3872</td><td>3865</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9ac13b7602d97035d77c6, 53e9a6edb7602d9703022e98, 53e9a415b7602d9702d2d959, 53e99d8eb7602d970264bba6, 53e9b3bcb7602d9703ea6281, 53e9bdb3b7602d9704a63257, 53e9b79fb7602d97043486cb, 53e9a90db7602d970325df8d)</td><td>Bias in the estimation of false discovery rate in microarray studies.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti626, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16105901?report=xml&format=text, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti626, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(53a002f0831432abcb742bb3, null, null, null, null, null, null, Bioinformatics, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>21</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>17179869419</td><td>53e99960b7602d970219fcb9</td><td>An on-line signature verification system exploiting global information is presented.

In their seminal work, Sette and Sidney defined nine HLA class I supertypes and claimed that these provide an almost perfect coverage of the entire repertoire of HLA class I molecules. HLA alleles are highly polymorphic and polygenic and therefore experimentally classifying each of these molecules to supertypes is at present an impossible task. Recently, a number of computational methods have been proposed for this task. These methods are based on defining protein similarity measures, derived from analysis of binding peptides or from analysis of the proteins themselves.In this paper we define both peptide derived and protein derived similarity measures, which are based on learning distance functions. The peptide derived measure is defined using a peptide-peptide distance function, which is learned using information about known binding and non-binding peptides. The protein derived similarity measure is defined using a protein-protein distance function, which is learned using information about alleles previously classified to supertypes by Sette and Sidney (1999). We compare the classification obtained by these two complimentary methods to previously suggested classification methods. In general, our results are in excellent agreement with the classifications suggested by Sette and Sidney (1999) and with those reported by Buus et al. (2004). The main important advantage of our proposed distance-based approach is that it makes use of two different and important immunological sources of information-HLA alleles and peptides that are known to bind or not bind to these alleles. Since each of our distance measures is trained using a different source of information, their combination can provide a more confident classification of alleles to supertypes.</td><td>List(List(53f46244dabfaefedbb78c7a, null, tomboy@cs.huji.ac.il, 5b86a359e1cd8e14a3ca0b6b, Tomer Hertz, null, null, null, 0000-0002-0561-1578, School of Computer Science and Engineering  Israel, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f439ffdabfaee1c0abe7c0, null, null, 5b86a359e1cd8e14a3ca0b6b, Chen Yanover, null, null, null, 0000-0003-3663-4286, School of Computer Science and Engineering  Israel, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1093/Bioinformatics/btl324</td><td>List(Epitope, Similarity measure, Repertoire, Metric (mathematics), Classification methods, Computational biology, Human leukocyte antigen, Genetics, Peptide binding, Mathematics, Distance measures)</td><td></td><td>1367-4811</td><td>2</td><td>List(hla class i molecule, distance function, similar peptide binding specificities, protein distance function, hla allele, distance measure, identifying hla supertypes, hla class, peptide distance function, similarity measure, defining protein similarity measure, polymorphism, human leukocyte antigen)</td><td>en</td><td>53</td><td>55</td><td>e148</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/227/210/144/53e99967b7602d97021aa74e_0.pdf</td><td>List(53e9aa0fb7602d970337e893, 53e9b16db7602d9703bf2f70, 53e9981db7602d9702039c13, 53e9a301b7602d9702c09e28, 53e9bb93b7602d97047d85d0, 558a504fe4b0b32fcb361446, 53e9b8d4b7602d97044b3b15, 53e9a7feb7602d970313e6c3, 53e9b8c6b7602d97044a3a9f, 53e99d28b7602d97025db627, 53e9a85cb7602d97031a9ac2, 53e99efbb7602d97027c9734, 53e9a79eb7602d97030d7eae)</td><td>Identifying HLA supertypes by learning distance functions.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/Bioinformatics/btl324, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237084?report=xml&format=text, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(53a002f0831432abcb742bb3, null, null, null, null, null, null, Bioinformatics, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>23</td><td>2007</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b3291c455f439fe40ec0</td><td>53e99967b7602d97021ac4e9</td><td>With impressive progress in Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solving and several extensions to pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, many applications that use SAT, such as high-performance formal verification techniques are still restricted to checking satisfiability of certain conditions. However, there is also frequently a need to express a preference for certain solutions. Extending SAT-solving to Boolean optimization allows the use of objective functions to describe a desirable solution. Although recent work in 0-1 Integer Linear Programming (ILP) offers extensions that can optimize a linear objective function, this is often achieved by solving a series of SAT or ILP decision problems. Our work articulates some pitfalls of this approach. An objective function may complicate the use of any symmetry that might be present in the given constraints, even when the constraints are unsatisfiable and the objective function is irrelevant. We propose several new techniques that treat objective functions differently from CNF/PB constraints and accelerate Boolean optimization in many practical cases. We also develop an adaptive flow that analyzes a given Boolean optimization problem and picks the symmetry-breaking technique that is best suited to the problem characteristics. Empirically, we show that for non-trivial objective functions that destroy constraint symmetries, the benefit of static symmetry-breaking is lost but dynamic symmetry-breaking accelerates problem-solving in many cases. We also introduce a new objective function, Localized Bit Selection (LBS), that can be used to specify a preference for bit values in formal verification applications.</td><td>List(List(53f42c87dabfaedce54b88fe, null, null, 5b86b6dbe1cd8e14a34d6779, Fadi A.

By dynamic programming along the associated branch- or tree-decomposition one can solve most graph optimization problems in time linear in the graph size and exponential in the parameter. If one of these parameters is bounded on a class of graphs, then so is the other, but they can differ by a small constant factor and this difference can be crucial for the resulting runtime. In this paper we introduce semi-nice tree-decompositions and show that they combine the best of both branchwidth and treewidth. We first give simple algorithms to transform a given tree-decomposition or branch-decomposition into a semi-nice tree-decomposition. We then give two templates for dynamic programming along a semi-nice tree-decomposition, one for optimization problems over vertex subsets and another for optimization problems over edge subsets. We show that the resulting runtime will match or beat the runtimes achieved by doing dynamic programming directly on either a branch- or tree-decomposition. For example, given a graph G on n vertices with path-, tree- and branch-decompositions of width pw,tw and bw respectively, the Minimum Dominating Set problem on G is solved in time O(n2^m^i^n^{^1^.^5^8^p^w^,^2^t^w^,^2^.^3^8^b^w^}) by a single dynamic programming algorithm along a semi-nice tree-decomposition. On the applied side the immediate gain is that for each optimization problem one can achieve the benefits of both treewidth, branchwidth and pathwidth while developing and implementing only one dynamic programming algorithm. On the theoretical side the combination of the best properties of both branchwidth and treewidth in a single decomposition is a step towards a more general framework giving the fastest possible algorithms on tree-like graphs.</td><td>List(List(53f4338bdabfaec09f160a1e, null, dorn@informatik.hu-berlin.de, 5b86ca76e1cd8e14a3da8793, Frederic Dorn, null, null, null, null, Institut f√ºr Informatik, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany, null, 5f71b2991c455f439fe3cfc5, List(Institut f√ºr Informatik, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany, Corresponding address: Institut fur Informatik, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Unter den Linden 6, 10099 Berlin, Berlin-Brandenburg, Germany.

It is based on refining a partition on states with respect to the labelled transitions. A splitter is a pair consisting of a set in the partition and a label. Earlier algorithms consume lots of time in scanning splitters that have no corresponding relevant transitions. The new algorithm avoids this by maintaining the sets of the corresponding transitions.

Recent efforts have highlighted the potential to improve performance by introducing methods to personalize services based on special knowledge about users and their context. For example, a user's demographics, location, and past search and browsing may be useful in enhancing the results offered in response to web search queries. However, reasonable concerns about privacy by both users, providers, and government agencies acting on behalf of citizens, may limit access by services to such information. We introduce and explore an economics of privacy in personalization, where people can opt to share personal information, in a standing or on-demand manner, in return for expected enhancements in the quality of an online service. We focus on the example of web search and formulate realistic objective functions for search efficacy and privacy. We demonstrate how we can find a provably near-optimal optimization of the utility-privacy tradeoff in an efficient manner. We evaluate our methodology on data drawn from a log of the search activity of volunteer participants. We separately assess users preferences about privacy and utility via a large-scale survey, aimed at eliciting preferences about peoples willingness to trade the sharing of personal data in returns for gains in search efficiency. We show that a significant level of personalization can be achieved using a relatively small amount of information about users.</td><td>List(List(53f48b19dabfaea6f277b55f, null, KRAUSEA@CALTECH.EDU, 5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca568, Andreas Krause, null, null, null, 0000-0001-7260-9673, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, null, 5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5a6, List(CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA), null, null), List(53f48d8bdabfaea7cd1d315a, null, null, 5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34ca02e, Eric Horvitz, null, null, null, null, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, null, 5f71b2831c455f439fe3c634, List(Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA), null, null))</td><td>10.1613/jair.3089</td><td>List(Internet privacy, World Wide Web, Economics of privacy, Computer science, Demographics, Personally identifiable information, Information privacy, Personalization, Government)</td><td></td><td>Journal Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Volume 39, pages\n  633-662, 2010</td><td>1</td><td>List(utility-theoretic approach, online service, heterogeneous user base, search activity, search efficiency, personal information, search efficacy, web search query, past search, web search, efficient manner, users preference)</td><td>en</td><td>96</td><td>662</td><td>633</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1235/1827/1253/53e9997eb7602d97021c2509_0.pdf</td><td>List(53e9b3f6b7602d9703ee9b20, 53e99a67b7602d97022d4c69, 53e9a254b7602d9702b58642, 53e99d74b7602d970262da19, 53e9ba9bb7602d97046c790a, 53e99bc6b7602d970246e1f8, 53e9ae84b7602d97038a4244, 53e9acb5b7602d9703691e11, 53e9b27bb7602d9703d1fce5, 53e9ab3eb7602d97034cd762, 53e9b048b7602d9703aa8533, 53e997f4b7602d9701ff7a0d, 55828f540cf2e37586b54edc, 53e99dccb7602d970268c461, 53e9b464b7602d9703f6590e, 53e9a099b7602d9702982496, 53e9b388b7602d9703e6a754, 53e9a79eb7602d97030da7c2, 599c7ce4601a182cd27e4c9a, 53e9b281b7602d9703d28e88, 53e9ae48b7602d970385d2e8, 53e9a53fb7602d9702e60c49, 53e99ecab7602d9702795c00, 53e9bc32b7602d97048a4059, 53e9a6c3b7602d9702ff7967, 53e9b9c0b7602d97045b24a7)</td><td>A utility-theoretic approach to privacy in online services</td><td>List(http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3859, https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3859, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1946417.1946431, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(53a7300320f7420be8cd3e55, null, null, null, null, null, null, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>abs/1401.3859</td><td>2010</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b4811c455f439fe4a759</td><td>53e99984b7602d97021c4f2e</td><td>Expert recommender systems have been introduced and implemented in various ways.

Using a single cell integrate and fire neuron model we show that the ratio of average inhibitory to excitatory conductance controls the balance between excitation and inhibition.

The effect of filtering with a number of spatial filters on detection efficiency is assessed. The algorithm was tested on an infrared image sequence of an aircraft approaching the sensor at low level over water with a diffuse cloud background, and it was found to perform significantly better than simple detection by threshold exceedance.

The most frequently occurring relationship type was the hypernym (e.g., Katherine Hepburn is an actress). The aim of the present work, therefore, was to develop a method for determining a person's occupation from syntactic data in a text corpus. First, in the P-System, we compared predicate‚Äìargument data involving a proper name for different occupations using Okapi's BM25 weighting algorithm. When classifying actors and using sufficiently frequent names, an accuracy of 0.955 was attained. For evaluation purposes, we also implemented a standard apposition-based classifier (A-System). This performs well, but only if a particular name happens to appear in apposition with the corresponding occupation. Last, we created a hybrid (H-System) which combines the strengths of P with those of A. Using data with a minimum of 100 predicate‚Äìargument pairs, H performed best with an overall lenient accuracy of 0.750 while A and P scored 0.615 and 0.656, respectively. We therefore conclude that a hybrid approach combining information from different sources is the best way to predict occupations. ¬© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</td><td>List(List(53f323b4dabfae9a84464e83, null, richard.sutcliffe@ul.ie, 5b86c4dce1cd8e14a3b21836, Kieran White, null, null, null, null, Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland, null, 5f71b2951c455f439fe3ce06, List(Univ Limerick, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Limerick, Ireland), null, null), List(53f42d17dabfaec22ba137d9, null, null, 5b86c4dce1cd8e14a3b21836, Richard F.

A prototype scientific application (MouseCam) was implemented to evaluate our design in a practical context. The middleware layer is flexible enough to work with a number of different types of data, including sequential JPEG images, as used in this prototype.

The purpose of CEP is the identification of patterns of events with logical, temporal or causal relationships out of single occurring events. The Rete algorithm is commonly used in rule-based systems to trigger certain actions if a corresponding rule holds. It allows for a high number of rules and is therefore ideally suited for event processing systems. However, traditional Rete networks are limited to operations such as unification and the extraction of predicates from a knowledge base. There is no support for temporal operators. We propose an extension of the Rete algorithm for support of temporal operators. Thereby, we are using interval time semantics. We present the issues created by this extension as well as our pursued methodology to address them. A description language is used to specify the patterns of interest. This specification is also called subscription to a complex event.

Since WSNs consists of a number of sensor nodes with limited capabilities, previous studies mainly discuss on how to send the data efficiently and do not consider the group mobility of mobile sinks that move together staying closely and randomly move within a geographically restricted region. Although the existing multicasting protocols could be applied, they suffer from high congestion and control overhead due to location updates by individual mobile sinks. Geocasting protocols are effective for data delivery to a sink group within a restricted region, but do not guarantee since they only focus on transmitting data to all nodes within a stationary region. Therefore, we propose Region Based Data Dissemination (RBDD) scheme to address these problems. RBDD provides efficient data dissemination scheme for mobile sink groups, so it guarantees data transmission when a sink group does not only move as a whole, but its member sinks also move inside of the region or outside of it. Simulation results show that RBDD guarantees data delivery to a mobile sink group.</td><td>List(List(53f439c5dabfaeee229ca39f, null, hjlee9@cclab.cnu.ac.kr, null, Hyungjoo Lee, null, null, null, null, Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea, null, null, List(Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea), null, null), List(53f43114dabfaee2a1cabb90, null, null, null, Jeongcheol Lee, null, null, null, null, Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea, null, null, List(Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea), null, null), List(53f66276dabfae439e2b560d, null, null, null, Sang-Ha Kim, null, null, null, null, Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea, null, null, List(Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 220 Gung Dong, Taejon 305764, South Korea), null, null), List(53f458e6dabfaedd74e37c24, null, null, null, SungKee Noh, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684154</td><td>List(Mobile computing, Mobile radio, Computer science, Computer network, Dissemination, Multicast, Wireless sensor network, Geocast, Sink (computing), Mobile telephony, Distributed computing)</td><td>978-1-4244-5637-6</td><td>1930-529X E-ISBN : 978-1-4244-5637-6</td><td></td><td>List(protocols, sensor nodes, region based data dissemination scheme, mobile sinks, mobile sink groups, sensing data, mobile radio, wireless sensor networks, multicasting protocols, data dissemination, data transmission, mobile communication, wireless sensor network, mobile computing)</td><td>en</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a93fb7602d97032943f1, 557fb58bf6678c77ea22b17d, 53e999c3b7602d970220b647, 53e9a38fb7602d9702c9bc06, 53e9a711b7602d970304636b, 53e99bcdb7602d9702478bd8, 53e9aa48b7602d97033b7da1)</td><td>Region Based Data Dissemination Scheme for Mobile Sink Groups in Wireless Sensor Networks</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684154, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5684154, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(555037577cea80f954182982, null, null, null, null, null, null, GLOBECOM, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2010</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b3da1c455f439fe45ceb</td><td>53e9998bb7602d97021cfa6f</td><td>Implications of a formal context obey Armstrong rules, which allows one to define a minimal (in the number of implications) implication basis, called Duquenne-Guigues basis or stem base in the literature.

Here we tested the role of predator removal on the contemporary evolution of prey traits such as movement, reproduction and foraging. We use EcoSim simulation which allows complex intra- and inter-specific interactions, based on individual evolving behavioral models, as well as complex predator‚Äìprey dynamics and coevolution in spatially homogenous and heterogeneous worlds. We model organisms' behavior using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) that are coded in their genomes which has a clear semantics making reasoning about causality of any evolved behavior possible. We show that the contemporary evolution of prey behavior owing to predator removal is also accompanied by prey genetic change. We employed machine learning methods, now recognized as holding great promise for the advancement of our understanding and prediction of ecological phenomena. A classification algorithm was used to demonstrate the difference between genomes belonging to prey coevolving with predators and prey evolving in the absence of predation pressure. We argue that predator introductions to naive prey might be destabilizing if prey have evolved and adapted to the absence of predators. Our results suggest that both predator introductions and predator removal from an ecosystem have widespread effects on the survival and evolution of prey by altering their genomes and behavior, even after relatively short time intervals. Our study highlights the need to consider both ecological and evolutionary time scales, as well as the complex interplay of behaviors between trophic levels, in determining the outcomes of predator‚Äìprey interactions.</td><td>List(List(53f433a8dabfaee0d9b4a5da, null, khater@uwindsor.ca, null, Marwa Khater, null, null, null, null, School of Computer Science,University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON, Canada, null, 5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0f7, List(School of Computer Science,University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON, Canada, Corresponding author.), null, null), List(53f43868dabfaec09f18fe3f, null, null, null, Dorian Murariu, null, null, null, null, Department of Biology, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON, Canada, null, 5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0f7, List(Department of Biology, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON, Canada), null, null), List(54057ca8dabfae92b41da635, null, null, null, Robin Gras, null, null, null, 0000-0002-0563-0250, School of Computer Science, Department of Biology University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Canada, null, 5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0f7, List(School of Computer Science, Department of Biology University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Canada, Great Lake Institute for Environmental Research, University of Windsor, Canada), null, null))</td><td>10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.02.005</td><td>List(Trophic level, Ecology, Coevolution, Predation, Biology, Prey switching, EcoSim, Predator, Foraging, Ecosystem)</td><td></td><td>1574-9541</td><td></td><td>List(Individual-based modeling, Predator‚Äìprey systems, Non-lethal effects, Machine learning, Predator removal)</td><td>en</td><td>11</td><td>22</td><td>13</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a9d8b7602d97033370f8, 558c070ee4b02b9f07a4a743, 53e9a19ab7602d9702a8e032, 53e9b7cdb7602d970437be9c, 53e9b879b7602d970444a04e, 53e9aa0fb7602d970337a805, 53e997fcb7602d970200a98a)</td><td>Contemporary evolution and genetic change of prey as a response to predator removal.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.02.005, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954114000223, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(null, 1574-9541, null, null, null, null, Elsevier, Ecological Informatics, null, ecological-informatics, null, J, null)</td><td>22</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>34359744218</td><td>53e99991b7602d97021d2292</td><td>The purpose of this paper is twofold.

A multifactor approach with the aid of nurse practitioners (NPs) is more beneficial for achieving treatment goals of risk factors than achieved with usual care in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Objective: In the SPAIN pilotstudy, we want to implement and test a secure personalized website with additional treatment and coaching of a NP for risk factors in patients with CVD. Fifty patients are going to use the patient-specific website for six months. At study begin; realistic treatment goal(s) for elevated risk factors are made between patients and the NP. Patients can enter new measurements and are stimulated to keep regular e-mail contact. The NP personally replies during working days and gives regular but protocol driven feedback and support. Data will be collected on login attempts, amount of messages, risk factor levels before and after intervention and on beliefs. Determinants of changing behaviour are collected. Results: The results can be expected at the beginning of 2007. Conclusion: This pilot-study will give insight in feasibility and satisfaction of patients and NP in electronically treatment of risk factors. Also information on the course of risk factors will be available.</td><td>List(List(53f31d40dabfae9a84441383, null, null, 5b868e86e1cd8e14a33fe139, Bertine M. B.

An onboard vision system should take weather effects into account. The effects of daylight fog vary across the scene and are exponential with respect to the depth of scene points. Because it is not possible in this context to compute the road scene structure beforehand, contrary to fixed camera surveillance, a new scheme is proposed. Fog density is first estimated and then used to restore the contrast using a flat-world assumption on the segmented free space in front of a moving vehicle. A scene structure is estimated and used to refine the restoration process. Results are presented using sample road scenes under foggy weather and assessed by computing the visibility level enhancement that is gained by the method. Finally, we show applications to the enhancement in daylight fog of low-level algorithms that are used in advanced camera-based driver assistance.</td><td>List(List(53f3604adabfae4b34982f07, null, null, 5b86ba08e1cd8e14a364416b, Nicolas Hauti√®re, null, null, null, null, Universit√© Paris-Est, Laboratory for Road Operation, Perception, Simulations, and Simulators, French and National Institute for Transportation and Safety Research, French and Public Works Res ..., null, 5f71b5671c455f439fe50f8b, List(), null, null), List(53f44edbdabfaeee22a17f18, null, null, 5b86ba08e1cd8e14a364416b, Jean-Philippe Tarel, null, null, null, null, Universit√© Paris-Est, Laboratory for Road Operation, Perception, Simulations, and Simulators, French and National Institute for Transportation and Safety Research, French and Public Works Res ..., null, 5f71b5671c455f439fe50f8b, List(), null, null), List(548883c7dabfaed7b5fa38f5, null, null, 5b8693cee1cd8e14a361aef8, Didier Aubert, null, null, null, null, UniverSud, Vehicle-Infrastructure-Driver Interactions Research Unit, French National Institute for Transportation and Safety Research, French Public Works Research Laboratory, Versailles, France, null, 5f71b2b41c455f439fe3dab3, List(), null, null))</td><td>10.1109/TITS.2010.2046165</td><td>List(Computer vision, Visibility, Poison control, Machine vision, Computer science, Advanced driver assistance systems, Distance fog, Daylight, Artificial intelligence, Weather forecasting, Daylighting)</td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td><td>List(climate mitigation, computer vision, daylighting, driver information systems, fog, image enhancement, image restoration, video surveillance, visibility, weather forecasting, adverse weather conditions, camera surveillance, contrast restoration, daylight fog, driver assistance, in-vehicle cameras, onboard vision system, visibility level enhancement, visibility loss, weather mitigation, Advanced driver-assistance systems, contrast restoration, fog removal, real-time image processing)</td><td>en</td><td>52</td><td>484</td><td>474</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/794/376/324/53e99997b7602d97021d991b_0.pdf</td><td>List(56d8e2c0dabfae2eee1d4822, 53e9a09fb7602d9702987f84, 558b106c84ae84d265c147cc, 53e9a4b2b7602d9702dd351e, 53e9ac0cb7602d97035cfa26, 558aae2fe4b031bae1f90bea, 53e9981db7602d9702039f2b, 53e9b808b7602d97043baf97, 558b016f84ae84d265c0ee95, 53e9bd11b7602d9704998f06, 53e99813b7602d970202cd5f, 53e99abeb7602d970233d5d0, 53e9afe1b7602d9703a35738, 558a52d0e4b037c087567427, 53e9b469b7602d9703f67418, 53e9abdab7602d970358f7c0, 53e9a3edb7602d9702d03b0e, 53e99efbb7602d97027cacb6, 53e9b4a6b7602d9703fb70a4)</td><td>Mitigation of visibility loss for advanced camera-based driver assistance</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2010.2046165, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5453086, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TITS.2010.2046165)</td><td>List(54825b3a582fc50b5e15ceb0, null, null, null, null, null, null, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>11</td><td>2010</td></tr><tr><td>5f71b6b61c455f439fe59e22</td><td>53e99998b7602d97021da103</td><td>When aggregating information from a group of agents, accepting the pieces of information shared by all agents is a natural requirement.

It turns out that existing operators satisfying (Disj) do not perform well with respect to the standard criteria used to evaluate merging operators: logical properties, computational complexity and strategy-proofness.

The centreline, chines and sheer lines of a vessel are modelled as B-spline curves. Between each pair of these boundary curves or directrix lines, the generator lines or rulings are created and a quasi-developable B-spline surface containing the rulings is defined. A procedure based on multiconic development is used to modify the directrix lines in case the rulings intersect inside the boundary curves, avoiding non-developable portions of the surface. B-spline curves and surfaces are widely used today in practically all the design and naval architecture computer programs.

Natural language processing (NLP) methods can be very useful for automatically extracting knowledge such as gene-drug interactions, offering researchers immediate access to published findings, and allowing curators a shortcut for their work. We present a corpus of gene-drug interactions for evaluating and training systems to extract those interactions. The corpus includes 551 sentences that have a mention of a drug and a gene from about 600 journals found to be relevant to pharmacogenomics through an analysis of gene-drug relationships in the PharmGKB knowledgebase. We evaluated basic approaches to automatic extraction, including gene and drug co-occurrence, co-occurrence plus interaction terms, and a linguistic pattern-based method. The linguistic pattern method had the highest precision (96.61%) but lowest recall (7.30%), for an f-score of 13.57%.

Methods based on hand-coded rule sets are laborous to build and not very reliable. This problem has led to an increasing interest in intrusion detection techniques based upon machine learning or data mining. However, traditional data mining based intrusion detection systems use single classifier in their detection engines. In this paper, we propose a meta learning based method for intrusion detection by MultiBoosting multi classifiers. MultiBoosting can form decision committees by combining AdaBoost with wagging. It is able to harness both AdaBoost's high bias and variance reduction with wagging's superior variance reduction. Experiments results show that MultiBoosting can improve the detection performance of state-of-art machine learning based intrusion detection techniques. Furthermore, we present a Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) based method for reducing network connection features to make MultiBoosting more efficient in real-time network environment, in the meanwhile, keep the detection performance unundermined and in some cases, even further improved.</td><td>List(List(53f42f4bdabfaee2a1c9490d, null, null, 5b86b6e2e1cd8e14a34d9c6c, Rongfang Bie, null, null, null, null, College of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, P.R.

The method uses simulated annealing to achieve a nearly optimal allocation of production rules onto processor nodes. The approach balances the initial rule distribution to avoid higher communication demand among processor nodes at run time. A formal mapping model is developed and a new cost function is defined for the annealing process. New heuristic swap functions and cooling policies are provided to ensure the quality of the annealing process. A software load balancing package, SIMAL, was implemented on a SUN workstation to carry out the benchmark experiments. The overhead associated with this mapping method is O ( m In m ), where m is the number of rules in the production system. Two benchmark production systems, Toru-waltz and Tourney , are mapped onto a hypercube computer with 32 nodes. Experimental benchmark results verify the effectiveness of the rule mapping method.
